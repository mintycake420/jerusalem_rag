TITLE: Attack on Acre (1179)

The attack on Acre in 1179 was a naval raid launched by the Ayyubid fleet of Saladin against the Crusader fortress of Acre. The Ayyubids attacked the fort and inflicted heavy damage on the port before retreating.


== Background ==
By the spring of 1179, the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin, had constructed the Ayyubid navy. He had 80 ships; 60 were galleys and 20 were transport ships. Saladin divided his navy into two parts: 50 were to protect Egyptian coasts, while 30 of them would attack the Crusaders.  The Ayyubid Navy began its operations in the same year. They attacked Levantine coasts, disrupting military and commercial activities there. In June, they captured cargo, two ships captured much loot, and 400 prisoners. 


== Raid ==
Encouraged by this victory, the Ayyubids launched another raid, this time towards the Crusader fortress of Acre, which Muslims considered the "Constantinople of Franks." On October 14, the Ayyubid navy sailed towards Acre at night. Acre Port had many ships and merchandise. The Ayyubid navy managed to capture and destroy several ships. The Ayyubid navy remained at the port, destroying it for 2 days, and retreated only after causing great damage to the port. The Ayyubids reportedly lost 3 men in this attack. The attack posed a challenge to Crusader's naval power. The Muslim historian, Abu Shama, said regarding the attack: "Our fleet, once destroyed, became in turn the destroyer of the enemy...Never was a similar victory achieved by a Muslim fleet".
