Oodeffroy of Boloyne, or the Siege and Conqueste of Jei-usalem, 
was printed by William Caxtoiiy as he himself informs us, in the 
Abbey of Westminster, the work being finished on the 20th of 
November, 1481. 

There are ten copies still extant of this edition : British Museum 
(1), Cambridge (2), Imperial Library, Vienna (1), Hunterian College, 
Glasgow (1), Baptist College, Bristol (1), and (4) in private libraries. 
The present edition was printed from the copy in the British Museum, 
which is described by Blades (Biography and Typography of Wm. 
Caxton, London, 1879), as follows : 

" The book is a small in-folio, containing 144 leaves, of which two 
are blank. Excepting the first two gatherings, the signatures are 
entirely in Arabic numerals. 

" Collation ;— A is A 3» with A* blank, b a 2» V being blank ; 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are aU 4"», 
17 is a 3». 

" Typographic peculiarities ; — ^There is no title page. A full page 
has forty lines, which are of even length, and measure 4f inches 
without folios or catchwords. Space is left at the commencement of 
chapters for the insertion of three to seven-line initials. — ^The volume 
commences with a blank leaf, after which follows the prologue or 
preface, the text beginning on A', with a space for a four-line initial, 
thus, ' The hye, courageous faytes and valyaunt actes of noble, illus- 
trious, and vertuous personnes, etc/, and ending halfway down the 
recto of the 6th folio, of sig. 17., the verso being blank."

viii Introdxtction. L CaxtorCs Text and its Original. 

Mr. Blades also states that the book is translated from the 
French, adding, ''the author of the book appears to be unknown." 
Happily, this last conjecture of Mr. Blades is a mistake, as the author 
of our text, far from being unknown, is no less a personage than 
William, Archbishop of Tyre from 1175 to 1184, and Carton's 
Godeffroye of Boloyne is a translation of the first hundred pages or so 
of a History of the First Crusade, and the French establishments in 
the Holy Laud, written by William, in the second half of the 12th 
century. 

It is a book which not only was a standard authority through all 
the Middle Ages, but one which even up to the present time is 
r^iarded as reliable in most particulars, and forms the base of all 
modem histories of this period. The book was written first in 
Latin, but was soon put into French, from which Caxton translated 
it into English, BEis translation is almost a literal one. He turns 
many of his French constructions into English, without any attempt 
at Anglicizing them, even transferring a French word bodily when he 
does not readily find its English equivalent. On the whole, he 
understands his French, although there are incorrect renderings here 
and there, owing more to hasty reading, it seems, than to actual 
ignorance. 

The editor of this text, in preparing it for publication, read the 
English first with a French Manuscript of the 15th century edition, 
from which without doubt it was translated. Curiously enough, 
MS. 68 of the Biblioth^ue Nationale, Paris, with which it was col- 
lated, belonged originally to Louis de Bruges, Seigneur de la Gruy- 
thuyse. Blades says of him : 

<< Among the nobles at the court of Phillip the Good (Duke of 
Burgundy, in 1419), many emulated the literary taste of their sove- 
reign, but none showed greater judgment and liberality in the 
formation of his library than Louis de Bruges. 

" This nobleman, who had risen by his talents to the highest 
position, received at his ch&teau of Oost-camp, near Bruges, in 1470, 
Edward lY. of England, when he sought refuge from the Lancas- 
trians, in Flanders, and was afterwards rewarded by the King with 
the title of Earl of Winchester. BEis library was sourcely inferior to 
that of his sovereign, and nearly the whole of its manuscripts were 
the production of Flemish artists, at Bruges or Ghent The large 
size of the volumes, the beauty of the vellum, the elegance of the 
writing, the artistic merit of the illuminations and ornaments, and 
the luxury displayed in the bindings are evidences of the interest

Introduction. I. Caxton's Text and its (h^ginal, ix 

taken by the Seigneur de la Gruythuyse in the formation of his 
library. 

<' At his death it passed to his son Jean, and was soon after added 
to the collection, already existing, at the chS,teau of Blois, belonging 
to the kings of France. Great pains were taken to obliterate the 
armorial bearings, devices, and monograms which showed the former 
owner of the manuscripts ; but these attempts were only partly suc- 
cessful, as about one hundred Tolumes, now among the most precious 
treasures of the Biblioth^ue Rationale of Paris, still attest that they 
once belonged to this celebrated collection.^ 

As Caxton lived for many years in Bruges, as the representative 
of the English nation, and was on friendly terms with many of the 
Flemish nobility, there is little doubt that he was well acquainted 
with the library of Louis de Bruges, and probably had himself spent 
many an hour over this very volume, which is a magnificent specimen 
of Flemish handicraft — a large in-folio, with writing like copper- 
plate, and adorned with many beautful artistically-executed minia- 
tures in grisaille. But, although as far as execution and binding are 
concerned, a book worthy of our highest praise, the text itself, which, 
as may be seen by the headings of the different chapters, is the same 
as the copy from which Caxton translated, is a very poor one, and 
the result is that many of Caxton*s sentences are faulty, obscure, or 
thoroughly unintelligible, owing to the faultiness and obscurity of 
his original. In many cases, the editor of the present text, in order 
to get at the original meaning, has been obliged to have recourse to 
vol. ii. of the Recueil des Oroisades, published by the Academy of 
Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, in Paris, which contains not only the 
corrected French text of WiUiam's history, but also the Latin original, 
to which an appeal has been made in doubtful cases. 

Some obscurities still remaining have been cleared up by Paulin 
Paris*8 recent edition of William of Tyre. 

For aid in this preface, and in the Index of Places and Names, 
at the dose of the book, the editor is also much indebted to the 
following authorities i

II. DIFFERENT EDITIONS, MANUSCRIPTS, AND TRANST^TIONS 
OF WILLIAM OF TYRE. 

The original histoiy was written, as has been already mentioned, 
in Latin. It was composed in Palestine, between the years 1163 and 
1183, and consisted of twenty-two completed books, divided into 
chapters, and of one chapter of a twenty-third book. The work was 
evidently either left unfinished, or mutilated after William's death, as 
he tells us expressly in his preface that he has divided his work into 
twenty-three books, each of which is in turn divided into chapters. 
" Distinximus autem volumem universam in libros zxiii, eorumque 
singulos certis designavimus capitulis, quo lectori facilius quicquid de 
articulis historise sibi viderit necessarium occurrat" The theory that 
portions of the history were destroyed after William's death, is a very 
plausible one, when we reflect that these closing chapters, if closing 
chapters there were, must have contained the record of events which 
did not present his political opponents in a very favourable light, so 
that they would have had every reason for suppressing them. 

The book commences with a brief general account of the situation 
of affairs before and at the time of the first crusade. Then follows a 
detailed account of that great movement, particular stress being laid 
on the part taken therein by the French and Flemish chivalry, and 
especially by Grodfrey of IBouillon. The ninth book treats of the 
taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders, and of the choice of Godfrey as 
king, closing with his sudden and unfortunate death. The other 
thirteen books contain the history of Palestine under French rule, 
down to the time of William's own death, which is supposed to have 
taken place in 1184. 

His preface, written after he had nearly completed his work, tells 
us of its aim and scope : —

xii //. EttwuI mid Bernard continue Willicm, of Tyre, 

" Narrationis seriem oidinavimus exordium, sumentes ab exitu 
virorum fortiura, et Deo amabilem prindpum qui, a regnis occidenta- 
libus, vocante Domino egressi, terram promissionis et pene univeream 
Syriane in manu forti sibi vendicaverunt, et inde usque ad regnum 
domini Balduini quarti, qui in ordine legum computato domino duce 
Godefrido qui primus regnum obtinuit, locum habuit septimum, per 
annos T. YXXT V, cum multa diligentia protraximus historiam." 

This history had, in the course of time, several different continu- 
ators. The first of these was one Emoul, member of a noble family 
of Giblet, a town of Palestine, on the coast north of Beirut Emoul, 
who must have been a weU-grown youth at the time of William's 
death, served as a young squire under Balian d'Tbelin, who had been 
made Lord Lieutenant of the kingdom of Jerusalem, after the capture 
of king Guy of Lusignan in 1187. Toung Emoul followed his master 
through all the vicissitudes of this critical period, and assisted in the 
defence of Jerusalem when besi^ed by Sdadin, a few months later. 
Years after, — after he had become one of the most able and learned 
jurists in the High Court of Cyprus, — ^Emoul of Giblet wrote, in the 
French language, an account of the events in which he had taken 
part^ his intention being to give the world a trothful narration of 
the conquest of Jerusalem, and of the irreparable loss of the Holy 
Gross. 

* Emoul's story stops with the year 1228. Here, however, an 
unknown pen takes it up, and, after some condensation of the pre- 
vious matter, brings it down to about 1231. This last writer narrates 
especially the events of the Crusade of Frederic II. of Germany, 
ending with the capture of St. Jean d'Acre. 

At about this same time, in France, one Bemard, called the 
treasurer, Bemaardua Theeaurius^ supposed to have belonged to the 
monasteiy of St Pierre in Corbie, wrote a history of affairs in the 
East, ending also with the year 1231. Corbie is a little town in 
France, east of Amiens. Here existed formerly a magnificent abbey 
of Benedictines of great wealth and antiquity, said to have been 
founded by Queen Bathilde in 662. The history of this abbey has 
been written by a Benedictine of Picardy, but nothing has been 
learnt of Bemard, except the fact that the office of treasurer has 
existed there since the 13th century. 

Already, before the continuation of the unknown author was 
finished, or Bernard's account was written, the Latin original ol, 
WiUiam of Tyre was known in France, where it received, without a 
doubt, the title with which it has come down to us, viz., Htgtaria

jRet-um in Partibus Transmarinis Gestafnim; and certainly by 1225, 
if not before, it was translated into French. 

Now we have, as we see, three or four different historians, all 
handling the same subject, but at different epochs. What more na- 
tural than that they should be arranged chronologically ; and by the 
omission of prefaces, and by judicious condensation, be made into one 
compact whole. This is exactly what was done by some one, per- 
haps by Bernard himself, who, after he had written his account of 
affairs in the Orient^ as an independent composition, may have con- 
ceived the idea of combining it with William's and Emoul's histories. 
Ee this as it may, the compilation closes with Bernard's work, which 
ends thus : Explicit liber ; ceste conte de la ierre cCOutremery fist faire 
li ti'esoriers Beifuirs de St Fien'e de Co7'bie en la caimaiion. Mello 
C.C. XXXII. 

'Naturally, for centuries, and even down to the modem critical 
examination of the book, Bernard was regarded as the real author of 
the whole work. His compilation was the history, par-exceUence, of 
the Crusades and the Holy Land through all the Middle Ages. 
Strangely enough, although the compiler left Bernard's name at the 
close of the book, he forgot to give it any title at the beginning ; 
and as a result of this forgetfulness, each editor, or even copyist, felt 
himself privileged to bestow upon the book what seemed to him a 
suitable appellation, so no one text probably in the whole history of 
literature has had so many different names. The most common and 
curious of all them is that of the Roman d'JSrdcles, a title given by 
some rubricator, because the first line begins, '' Les andermes ystoires 
dient qiie Evades enfut moult bon Chrestien, et gouvemeur de Vempire 
de Bomme" William having introduced his history by recalling the 
fact of the conquest of- Jerusalem by the Persians, and their deliver- 
ance by the Emperor Heraclius, in 629. Other more appropriate 
titles are : Le Livre dee Passages d* Outre Mer; Le Livre de P Acqui- 
sition etdela Perte de la Terre Sainie; Les Chronigues d* Outre Mer; 
Livres des Voyages d, la Terre Sainte; Hietoires du Passage de Gode- 
froy de Bouillon, or simply, Le Livre du C&nqyMe, 

Emoul and Bernard form what M. Mas-Latrie, — who first 
disentangled the intricate relations of the different editions of 
William of Tyre to each other, — calls the "first epoch" of his 
continuators. 

A few years later, than Bernard, in 1248, St. Louis of France 
'*put on the cross," and departed for the Holy Land; the attention

of the Christian world was again drawn towards the East, and new 
deeds of valour called for a new chronicler. Another continuation 
was composed in the French language, taking the narrative up where 
Bernard left it, and bringing it down to the year 1261. lliis con- 
tinuation has been published in the French Academy edition of the 
continuators of William of Tyre^ imder the title, Coniinuation cCapris 
le Manuscrii de Rothdin. 

Soon after this appeared what may be called the third series of con- 
tinuators. This third series is not a direct continuation of the second 
series. It does not take up the naisative where that left it^ in 1261, 
but attaches itself to Emoul and Bernard, that is, to the first class of 
continuators, and closes with the year 1275. This third continuation, 
according to the best judges, is the work of two hands, and was 
written entirely in the East The first half is supposed to have been 
the composition of a knight of Cyprus or Syria, and contains the 
history of the kingdoms of Cyprus and Jerusalem, united during the 
minority of King Henry III. of Lusignan; the latter half, which 
narrates the events transpiring between 1248 and 1275, seems to 
have been written by a monk, as it is more scholarly in style and 
character. 

The fourth and last group of continuators are only copies of the 
second series (that closing in 1261), to which has been added an 
account of the taking of St Jean d' Acre, and of events subsequent to 
1288, so that, in this edition, there is a gap in the history, from 1261 
to 1288. 

Most of these different series exist only in manuscript, there 
being several copies of each known. M. Biant, in Lea Arehivee de 
VOrieni LaHn, gives the following summary of the manuscripts of 
William of Tyre and his continuators, suppressing very justly M. 
Mas-Latrie's last class, which (as he observes) differs from tiie others 
only by the addition of matter that is really foreign to the rest of the 
work.

Y. Class. William of Tyre translated and continued down to

. An excellent description of many of these manuscripls is given in 
voL iL of the BecueU des Croisades, published by the French 
Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. 

Taking into consideration the extreme popularity of William of 
Tyre's history in France, as attested by the large number of manu- 
scripts still existing, it is strange that m(»re translations into other 
languages have not been found. Of those known, but one seems to 
have been in any sense a popular book, namely, that into Spanish, 
which is known under the title of La Gran Conquista de Ultra 
Mar. This is a vast compilation, of which M. Gaston Paris has 
commenced to give ua the first satisfactory analysis in the Romania^ 
Na 68, Oct 1888. La Gran Conquista takes as its basis the 
history of William of Tyre^ inserting at appropriate intervals other 
French compositions treating of the Crusades or of Godfrey of 
Bouillon, such as La Chanson d^AriiiocJiy La Cluxnson de Jerusalem, 
Le Chevdllier au Cygne^ the poem of Les Cliitifs^ ako the romans of 
Berths^ of Mainet, of Flore and Blandifleur. It is an immense work, 
filling a volume of 659 pages of two columns each, of a quarto 
edition. The date of this compilation is uncertain. The prologue of 
the first printed edition, that of 1503, states that it was made at the 
suggestion and under the auspices of Alphonso X. of Castile, who 
reigned from 1252 to 1284. The epilogue of a manuscript ^of the 
15th century attributes it to Alphonso XL, who died in 1350, 
while the epilogue of the oldest manuscript known, that of the 14th 
century, gtves the merit of the undertaking to the son of Alphonso X., 
Sancho IV., who died in 1295. M. Paris remarks that this latter 
date is probably the correct one, — the first being too remote, and the 
second too recent, to be accepted. Both of the ej^ilognes mentioned 
state that the kings of whom they speak caused the book to be 
translated from the French into Castillian. 

There is no doubt that the Spanish translator possessed a copy of 
William of Tyre with the third series of continuators, namely, that 
bringing it down to 1275, as La Gran Conquida follows that edition 
closely/ with additions (according to. M. Paris) fix>m a source still

unknown. M. Paris also conjectures that the French MS. at the 
disposal of the arranger of the book may have been a defective one, 
as the translation breaks off abruptly in the middle of a sentence, 
leaving the narration at the beginning of the year 1271. Ticknor, in 
a note on La Gran Conquista^ in his Histoii/ of Spanish Life- 
raiurey says that its closing chapters (those giving an account of 
Conrad of Hohenstaufen, and the assassination Df Henry, grand- 
son of Henry HI. of £ngland, at Yiterbo) were added by the 
Spanish arranger; but a comparison with the original shows that 
these details were all literally and exactly translated from the 
French. 

Of La Gran Conqmsta tiiree manuscripts are known : two in the 
National Library at Madrid, and one in the Eoyal Library. The 
first printed edition was that of Hans Giessen, Salamanca 1503, in 
folio. A later edition is that of Madrid 1858, in 8vo. 

We have one English translation, that made by William Coxton, 
printed for the first time in 1481, and reprinted in the present 
volume. 

Caxton made his translation from the same edition as La Gran 
Conquista, viz. that ending with the year 1275. 

Biant in his enumeration of the versions of Eracles, mentions a

This manuscript is a paper one, in folio, containing 256 leaves, and 
written about the middle of the 16th century, apparently late in the 
reign of Henry YJULj instead of in the 15th century, as Biant gives 
it» on the authority of the old Boyal Catalogue, by Casley, which is 
wronjf. \

journey to the Holy Laud, and rules for the behaviour of pilgrims 
eu route. 

Part IL of this compilation is supposed by Eiant to be a direct 
translation of the compiler from one of the numerous French editions 
of William of Tyre. On investigation, however, it proves to be only 
a condensation of Caxton's translation. 

The first chapters consist of a genealogy and biography of Godfrey 
of Bomllon, taken without doubt, as its author says, from the ^' IX 
boke of the IX worthies in french." After this introduction, the 
history of the First Crusade is taken up, at the departure of Gautier 
Sans Avoir for the Holy Land, and continued down to the death of 
Godfrey. The close of this book, at the same point where Caxton 
ends his translation, together with the fact that all of Caxton's mis- 
tiikes in translation and in proper names are found in it, is pretty 
conclusive proof that our unknown arranger did not trouble himself 
to go back to the French for his materials, but availed himself of 
Caxton's translation. The matter is very materially abridged, the 
condensations being made with great ability and discretion by omit- 
ting the long rhetorical speeches, and giving their substance in brief. 
Llany minor and unimportant details are also judiciously omitted j 
the wording is in general exactly that of Caxtou. 

The fifth part of this compilation, that translated £rom Fr^re 
Haiton, was published in 1526 by Pynson, but the first, third, and 
fourth seem never to have been printed. 

As to the translations into German, it is not easy to decide from 
the brief descriptions given, whether those mentioned by bibUo- 
graphers are really translations of William of Tyre, or of the poems 
of Godfrey of Bouillon, and the Chevalier an Oygne, which were . 
extremely popular in the 13th and Hth centuries, and w^re rendered 
into a prose form, which caused them to resemble not a little the 
genuine history, and to be often confounded with it. 

Brunet, in his Manuel du Libraire, under the heading *' Godefroy 
de Bouillon," and M. Reiifenbeig (Int. to Le Chevalier au Cygrte) 
mention several German and Flemish translations of the romance of 
Chdefroid de Bouillon. The oldest of tliesc Brunet describes as 
follows : 

"It was printed at Augsburg in 1482, with this title 'Hienach 
folgt. ein warhaft und bewerte historie wie die turche un andre 
geschlecht der ungleiibigen die cristeltichen Kirche,' etc.; on the back

The book is a Gothic in-folio. It contains 47 balf-page wood- 
cuts. -This book is mentioned by Zapf, History of Pnnting in 
Attgehurg^ L, p. 65, No. 21, under the title of Hisiarie van der 
Kreniz Fahrt. It was reprinted at Augsburg in 1502 by Luca9 
Zeizsenmeier under the following title : Herzog Godfiied wie er tinder 
die Tttrgen und hayden geatritten. 

No reliable analysis of the contents of these books seems ever to 
have been made ; but the Biblioth^ue Rationale of Paris, according 
to M. Brunety possesses a Flemisb translation of this same work 
printed at Harlem in 1486^ and reprinted in Antwerp in 1510 and 
1511. This Flemish copy, however, on the authority of M. Pigeon- 
neau (Le Cyde de la Oroiaade et de la FamiUe de Bouillon), who 
has exauiued it, is not at all a copy of either the poeiu of Le 
Chevalier au Cygne or of Godefroid de Bouillon^ or of both combined, 
but is a translation of William of Tyre; so the conclusion is that 
the Augsburg German editions must also be translations of William's 
histoiy. Pigeonneau gives the following description of the Flemish 
book : '< It is a small in-quarto, without title, date and name of editor, 
printed in Gothic characters and ornamented (like the Augsburg 
edition of 1482) with 47 wood cuts. It commences with these 
words, * Hier heghient pi'ologhe van der Seoene hietorien Hertoghe 
Godetoort van BoloenJ ** 

In Italy the first translation into the popular language that I 
have been able to find, with the limited means of research at my dis- 
posal, is that by Lorenza di Firenze, which bears the date of 1347, 
and the following title, *' H librp del Passagio di Terra Sancta, et e 
traslato di francescho in fiorentino, per Lorenzo di Firenze cittadino." 
This manuscript is to be found in the Laurentian Library in Florence, 
is written on veUum, is in folio, and is translated from the second 
class of William of Tyre's editions. Its designation is Phet LXI, 
No. 44^ In 1562, at Venice, an Italian translation was printed by 
Guiseppe Horologgi, entitled, " Historia della guerra sacra de Gerusa- 
lemme della terra promissione, et de tutti la Soria ricuperata da 
chiistiani da Guglielmo arcevesco di Tiro, tradotta da Guiseppe 
Horologgi, Yenetia 1562." Guizot in La CoUeetion dee Memoires 
8ur VHistoire de France, voL xvi, p. 14, mentions a third Italian 
translation made by one Thomas Bi^lioni, in 1610, and also published 
in Venice.

//. Latin JRe'translatio7i$ of William of Tyre. xix 

The most curious thing al>out the history of our book is its 
re-translation into Latin, at an early date, showing tliat the French 
translation must have been considei-ed the original composition^ and 
that the Latin original was comparatively unknown. Li 1725, 
Muratori published n collection of Italian historians, entitled Rerum 
Italicai'um Scriptorea. Among these historians he included Fran- 
cisco Pipino, a monk of Bologna, who lived in the first half of the 
14th century, and wrote in Latin a history of the First Crusade and 
the events which transpired in the Holy Land between the years 
1095 and 1230. His book is introduced by the following statement : 
^'Here commences the history of the Conquest of the Holy Land, 
which the author has translated from French into Latin." He closes 
thus : '' All these things, about the life and deeds of King John, are 
taken from the history of Bernard the Treasurer." Pipino trans- 
lated, as can easily be seen, from a manuscript of the third class, 
that containing the continuation of Ernoul and Bernard, which he, 
like everybody else, regarded as the work of Bernard alone. 

Eiant, in his list of the versions of Eracles, also cites two other 
Latin re-translations, both»anonymous : one in the University Library 
at Leyden (Yoss 110). This is a paper foUo of the 16th century, 
and is supposed to be a copy of an old MS. ^vritten in Italy. The 
second is at Utrecht, No. 285 of the City Library, a manuscript of 
the 15th century, although this latter piece of information seems to 
be regarded as doubtful by M. Riant. 

We have also very good evidence that a Latin re-translation was 
made in England as early as the first half of the 13th century. 
Ealph, prior at this time of the monastery of Coggeshall in Essex, 
wrote a history of the Holy Land, which he calls Chronicmi Terra 
SancUBf describing especially the siege of Jerusalem by Saladin, at 
which he himself had been present. In order to excuse the lack of 
details in regard to many previous events in the history of the 
European establishments in Palestine, Ealph refers his readers to a 
Latin history treating of these events, and lately translated from the 
French by the prior of the Holy Trinity in London, a book which 
could hardly fail to be one of the earlier editions of William of 
Tyre, 

Since the invention of printing, there have been many excellent 
editions of W^iam of Tyre^ both in Latin and French. It was 
published for ihe first time in Latin in 1549, in B&le, in folio, by 
Phillibert Poyssenot of Ddle. Henri Panteleon issued a new edition

in the some city in 1564, adding a continuation, also in Latin, 
written by one John Herold^ a learned German of the- ICfch century; 
and a native of Hochstadt, in Suabia. Herold narrates the history 
of the Ho]y Land from 1185, bringing it down as late as the year 
1527. The earliest French edition printed was that published in 
Paris in 1575, in folio, under the title ** Histoire de la guerre Sainte 
Dite proprement La Franciade orientale, faite latine par Guillaume 
archev^esque de Tyr, et traduit en Frangais par Gabr. du Pr^u." 
In 1611 Bongars published a collection of Latin writers on the 
Crusades, under tbe title Gesia Dei per Francos, 2 vol in folio, in 
which he included William of Tyre. Between 1724 and 1733, Dom 
Mart^ne and Dom Durand, benedictines of St. Maur, men of great 
learning and research, published a second collection of Latin authors 
on the Crusades, entitled Amplissima CoUectio, in 9 vols., folio. The 
firth volume of this collection contains the Latin version of William 
of Tyre. 

Other more modem editions of importance are those of Migne, 
Patrologics Latirus Cursus, vol. 201, and Guizot, vols. 16—18 of the 
Collection des Memoii'es sur VHistoire de Finance, Paris 1823 — 25. 
The Acadtmie des Inscriptions et Belles Letti'es commenced in the 
first half of this century a collection of texts relating to the Crusades, 
entitled Bectteil des Oroisddes: vols. I and II, which appeared in 
1944, contain not only the Latin, but the corresponding French text 
of William of Tyre. The latest edition in the French language, and 
without a doubt the most accurate and scholarly that has yet 
appeared, is that of Paulin Paris, Paris 1879, which contains, how- 
ever, simply the history as written by William, without any of the 
various continuations. 

III. WILLIAM OF TYRE. 

Of William of Tyre, second archbishop of the name, but little is 
known, except what can be gathered from his own writings. He 
was bom about 1130, without a doubt in Palestine, which, in the 
prologue to his history, he calls his beloved birth-place, Natalis soli 
magis iracH dxdcedine. He was probably of French descent, as 
9hown by his familiarity with French ways and customs, people and 
events, although Paulin Paris hazards the supposition that he was an 
Italian, as he speaks of being called to Home on one occasion, not 
only by public business, but also by private affairs.

IIL William of Tyre. His Birth aiid Rank. xxi 

As to his rank, authorities differ; Prutz (Ncites Archiv der 
GescMcJUe, etc., vol. viii. p. 93), stating that he was from a middle- 
class family. Prutz bases his couclusion on a Gartulaiy of the 
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, of the year 1175, in wliicli the name 
of a certain Radolphus, brother of the archbishop, William of Tyre, 
occurs, as belonging to a family not of noble rank. On the other 
hand, Pastouret (Hist. Litt de Id France^ vol. xiv., p. 688) affirms, 
on the authority of one Etienne of Lusigran, author of a history of 
Cyprus, that William of Tyre was related to some of the leading 
nobles of the kingdom of Jerusalem. However this may be, it is 
certain that he was brought up in or near Jerusalem, with which he 
was thoroughly acquainted. Every part of tlie city is knoAvn to him 
intimately, not only as it was in his day, but as it had been in the 
past In mentioning Jerusalem, he always calls it " regio nostra," 
and when speaking of anything in connection with that city or its 
inhabitants, he says " we,** " ours," to distinguish it from the Princi- 
pality of Antioch or the Counties of Tripolis and Edessa. On this 
subject we have also the authority of the unknown continuator of 
William, who tells us (Book XXIIL, chap. 10): "The archbishop 
of Tyre was called William, and was born in Jerusalem." 

As to the exact date of his birth it is difficult to decide, although 
l)oth French and German savants have spent much time in investigat- 
ing this point. We can only judge approximately by incidental 
remarks tliat William makes about fresh events in his life. He cer- 
tainly studied, as a young man, for a time at least, in Europe. He 
says of himself that ho was studying '* tmns mare " at the time of the 
divorce of Amalric, king of Jerusalem, from Agnes of Courtenay, 
daughter of Joscelin II., Count of Edessa in 1162 (Book XIX., 
chap. 4) : 

"Quaesivimus sane nos postea diligontur, tamquam circa talia 
curiosi quoto consanguinitas gradu se contingent, qui non de scholis 
redieramus, sed trans mare, circa liberalium artium adhuc detine- 
bantur studia, quando Hierosolymis haec facta sunt." 

Just where he was studying is only to be conjectured. Pastouret 
imagines in Paris, while other authorities remark that he seems very 
well acquainted with Rome; and the supjwsition has even been 
advanced that his studies may have been prosecuted at Constanti- 
nople, which theory would account for his thorough knowledge of 
the Greek language, and also for his acquaintance with Byzantine 
politics and dignitaries. Whei'ever lie received his education, it was

most certainly unusually thorough and extensive, embracing a range 
of studies which only a man brought into constant contact with both 
the Occidental and Oriental civili^tion and literature would pursue 
at this epoch. 

That he was an excellent Latinist is shown, not only by his fine 
style, which compares favourably with any other composition that the 
Middle Ages produced, but by his extended acquaintance with 
classical Latin literature, citations and references being found in his 
history from nearly all the best-known Latin authors, such as Ovid, 
Yirgil, Horace, Lucan, Juvenal, Statins, Terence, Cicero, Livy, and 
Sallust Of hk proficiency in the Greek language there is no doubt. 
He says liimself that he spoke it (Book XTTT., chaps. 1 and 2), and 
the fact that he was sent on more than one diplomatic mission to 
Constantinople confirms his T>wn statement He also spoke and read 
Arabic with ease< In speaking of his History of the Arab Priiices^ 
he tells us that he followed mainly Arabian authorities. His explan- 
ation of Arabic terms also shows his familiarity with the language. 

A young priest of his learning and abilities did not have to wait 
long for preferment, and in 1163, which must have been immediately 
after his return from his Western studies, we find him figuring as a 
Canon of the church in Tyre. Although not living in Jerusalem, 
William evidently soon became a special favourite with the king, 
Amalrio L, ai whose request he was made an archdeacon on the Ist 
of September, 1167. The little kingdom of Jerusalem was at this 
time agitated by the plan that Amalric hod conceived of subjugating 
Egypt For many years a dvil war had been waged in that country 
headed by two rival riziers. As each party was threatened with 
defeat^ it had applied in tarn to the Turks or to the Latins for idd, 
so that Amalrio bad had an excellent opportunity for obtaining a 
thorough knowledge both f)f the wealth and of the weakness of his 
neighbours. Induced partly by cupidity, and partly by fear of 
the Turks, — who under the brave IToureddin were becoming more 
powerful every day, — Amalric decided that the time had come for a* 
serious invasion of Egypt, and, to this end, he sent an embassy to 
Constantinople to ask for assistance from the Emperor Manuel, whose 
niece he had lately married. William, the newly-made archdeacon, 
accompanied this embassy, which was composed of Greeks and 
Latins. He remained in Constantinople, presumably on business for 
the king, until October 1168, when he returned to Tyre and to his 
church duties. His relations to his archbishop seem, however, not

to have heen very agreeable, and in a few months, early in 1169, we 
find him startiog for Rome, partly, as be expressly states, on private 
business, and partly to get out of the way of his unfriendly superior. 
Towards the close of this same year he returned to Palestine, but not 
to Tyre, as Amalric offered him the tutorship of his nine-year-old 
son, afterwards known as Baldwin IV. or Baldwin the Leper. From 
this time on, William lived in Jerusalem, and seems to have grown 
daily in favour with the king, already well-disposed towards him. 

That William was a kind and able instructor is not to be doubted 
by any one who reads the accounts that he gives of his royal charge. 
The most interesting is that of Book XXI., chap. 1 : — 

''The child made great progress in his studies, and more and 
more gave us reason to centre our hopes upon him. He had a fine 
figure, and was more skilful in riding and controlling a horse than 
any of his ancestors had been. He had a good memory, and was 
fond of conversing. He was economical, and remembered a kind- 
ness done to him as well as an injury. He resembled his father, not 
only in face but in form, and in his walk, and the sound of his 
voice. His mind was quick, but his tongue was slow. like his 
father, also, he was fond of hearing interesting stories told, and was 
always ready to follow good advice.** 

The boy seems in return to have conceived a deep attachment for 
the wise and learned prelate. 

In 1173 Amalric died, and Baldwin succeeded to the throne, at 
the age of 13. The future did not promise tranquillity or happiness 
to the young king, who was even then afflicted with an incurable 
and loathsome malady. The political situation of Jerusalem, always 
one of danger, was at this time more precarious than ever. Weakened 
by the fruitless attempts of Amalric to conquer Egypt^ it was now 
torn by internal dissensions, as the more powerful barens contended 
among themselves for the supremacy, foreseeing the speedy death of 
the sick boy. Amidst this confusion the fortunes of William throve 
steadily. He was immediately appointed Chancellor of the Kingdom, 
as he tells us, Book XXL, chap. 5, ^'ut esset qui regiamm episto- 
larum curam habenU" Very soon after, in 1174, Bishop Badulphns 
of Bethlehem died, and William was installed in the vacant bishopric. 
At about the same time he must have been made archdeacon of the 
chureh in Nazareth, as the records show him in possession of this 
dignity in December 1 1 74. The very next year, his old enemy, Frederic 
Archbishop of Tyre, died, and William was named as his successor. 
For the next three years we find William occupied with his double

duties as Chancellor and as Archbishop, keeping an attentive eye on 
the political condition of his land, — which we know from his own 
words was a constant and ever-increasing source of anxiety to him, — 
and at the same time defending firmly the rights of his pupil against 
all encroachments. In September 1 178 he went with the dignitaries 
of the Holy Land to Rome, to the third Council held in St. John 
Lateran. There he was deputed to draw up a report of the Council, 
of the number of persons present, of its proceedings, and its decisions. 
He remained in Home until September 1179, when he started for home, 
stopping on the way seveml months at the court of Manuel, £n)peror 
of Constantinople, on political business, and arriving in Tyre the 6th 
of July, 11 80. On his return, William found liis native land in 
greater need than ever of wise counsels and energetic action, and 
from this time on he occupied himself much more with statesmanship 
than with ecclesiastical matters. The rapidly increasing power of 
Saladin was a source of the greatest apprehension to the feeble little 
Latin kingdom, and none saw more dearly than William, the dangers 
that tlireatened them, or strove more untiringly to prepare for the 
struggle which was inevitably to come. Although his home was 
osteusibly in Tyre, he spent aU of his time in Jerusalem with the 
young king. 

Late in the year 1182 came the news of Saladin's approach at the 
head of a powerful army. After ravaging Galilee, Saladin commenced 
the siege of Beirut Baldwin, accompanied by William, hastened to 
Tyre, where a fleet was fitted out to be sent to the rescue of the 
threatened city. The two, pupil and master, celebrated Christmas at 
Tyre, and then returned in January 1183 to Jerusalem. 

This is the last positive leoord by himself that we have of 
William of Tyre. The last chapter of his history mentions the Inci- 
dents of the spring and summer of this year, without any specific 
information as to his own movements. Of the date of his death, 
nothing certain is known. Emoul, in his continuation, gives the 
following account of it. — In 1180, Amalric, patriarch of Jerusalem, 
died. The question of his successor was one of great importance, as 
the position of spiritual director of th& Holy City, and that of 
guardian of the Holy Sepulchre, was regarded by the whole Christian 
world as one of the most honourable that the Church had in its gift, 
Sybilla, mother of the infant Baldwin V., favoured Heradius of 
Cffisarea, a man of fine personal appearance : " Beau clerc 6tait>" says 
Emoul, *• et pour sa beauti Tama la m^re le roi." His habits, however,

were dissolute, and William opposed him energetically, not only on 
the ground of his personal nnfitness for this lofty position, hut also 
because of a prophecy that the Holy Crosd which had been brought 
back to Jerusalem under a Heraclius, should be taken away again 
under a Heraclius. 

Heraclius, notwithstanding, received the patriarchate. William, 
convinced of the evils that would result from this uuwoi-thy choice 
at such a critical time, decided to appeal to Eome, and hastened 
hither to prevent if possible its confirmation. Here he died sud- 
denly, killed, it was supposed, by poison administered by a phy- 
siciiin sent after him for that purpose by Heraclius. As the quaint 
old French of the ISth century has it, '' Quand Eracle sut qu'il ala k 
Some, dist a un sien lisicien qu'il alast apr^ et quil Tempoissonast ; 
et cil si fist ; si fn mort." 

IV. WILLIAM OF TYRE'S LITERABY WORKS. 

The literary productions of William of Tyre, of which we have 
to-day any knowledge, are three in number. 

I. The already mentioned Eeport of the Thii-d Lateran Council, 
held in Eome in 1179. In his 21st Book, chap. 26, William refers 
*P this Eeport thus : " If any one would like to know the statutes 
of tliis Council, the names, the number, and the titles of the bishops 
who were pi-esent, let him read the account that we wrote of it, at 
the request of the holy fathers who were there present, which we 
have caused to be deposited in the archives of the holy church at 
Tyre, among other books that we have placed there.** 

II. A History of the Arabian Princes, from the time of Mahomet 
up to the year 1184. This book which was entitled De Gestis 
Orienialium Principunif or De OrientcUibus Prtncipibus et eorwn 
AcHhuSy is now unfortunately lost, but in the prologue to his History 
of the First Crusade, William speaks of having written it, and says 
that he was urged to undertake it by King Amalric, who procured 
for him the Arabian books that he used as authorities, especially the 
history of Seith, patriarch of Alexandria, which he followed mainly. 

'' Cujus etiam rogatu ipso Aiabica exempleria menestrante alium 
historiam, a tempore seductoris Mahumeth usque in hunc annum, 
qui est nobis ad incamatione Domini M.C.L.XXXiy, per Annos

secuti virum venerabilem Soith, filium Patrici, Alexandrinum patri- 
archunu"

xxvi IV. William of Tyre*s LUerary Works. 

He also mentions this same work in several other places, namely, 
Book L chap. 3, Book XIX. chapters 15 and 21. 

This ** yenerabilem Seith " is, according to the best authorities, 
Said Ibn Batrik, bom in Egypt in 879. He was a celebrated phy- 
sician, and was for many years Patriarch of Alexandria. His book 
was written in Arabic, and contained a history of the world, from 
the time of Adam up to the year 326 of the Hegira, that is, up to 
937 A.D. The Arabic word Said or Seith, meaning <^ the fortunate 
oncy** was transformed into Eutychius, in Greek; and the same 
history was published in a Latin and Arabic edition, at Oxford, 
in the 17th century, by one Pococke, under the title S. JEtdyehii 
PaMarehi Alexcmdrini Armcdes Lai. et Arah.t ed. Poeocke^ Oxon. 
1658. 

in. William's third work was his History of thd First Crusade 
and of the Establishments founded in the East by the Crusaders, or, 
as the title runs — Hidoria rerum inparHbus transmarinis Gestarum. 
This is really the great work of his life, and the work on which his 
literary fame rests. Soon after his return from his Eastern studies, 
in 1163, he conceived the plan of writing a truthful and unbiassed 
histoiy of Latin affairs in the East. Eling Amalric encouraged him 
also in this literary undertaking, and volunteered to assist him in 
every way possible. The first eleven books were finished, the internal 
evidence shows us, before the summer of 1173 : book fourteen, after 
William was made Archbishop; and the first chapter of the unfinished 
twenty-third book must have been written in the last year of his 
life. According to these data, the book occupied him for twenty 
years. 

When we consider William of Tyre's merits as a historian critic- 
ally, and compare him with other writers of the same period, it is 
not difficult to see that he far surpasses them all, and that his work 
is, in fact) the first hidory^ in the modem sense of the word, and the 
best, that the Middle Ages have to show us. The list of authors 
who have treated of the same subject is a long one, but none are at 
aU worthy to be compared with William, either in learning, ability, 
style, or arrangement of materials. We have, first, the narratives of 
those men who were themselves eye-witnesses of the events they 
record-Miiffuse, ill-arranged chronicles, generally written from a par- 
tisan standpoint, to celebrate the prowess and doughty deeds either 
of one great noble or hero, or of one nation or section of a nation. 
Under this head may be ranked Baymond of Agiles, who accompanied

the Count of Toulouse on the First Crusade. Naturally, his liege 
lord and the hot-headed superstitious Proven9als have the leading 
places in his account of things. Then comes an anonymous writer, 
attached probably to Bohemond, Prince of Tarentum, -whose adven- 
tures and prowesses he narrates at length. Foucher of Chartres is 
the next in order, with Lis chronicle, which he calls Gesta Pejegriu" 
antium Francorum. Foucher started for the Holy Land in the suite 
of Robert of Normandy and Steven of Blois, but soon left them for 
Baldwin, the brother of Godfrey of Boulogne, whom he followed to 
Edessa, so that his narrative recounts the deeds and conquests of the 
North Frenchmen and Flemish. 

In many instances these accounts disagree tptally, and the aim of 
their authors seems to be, not so much to give a fair, dispassionate, 
accurate statement of what happened, as to make everything as mar- 
vellous and wonderful as possible. As to the historians who were 
not eye-witnesses— of whom Albert of Aix (Albertus Aquensis) is a 
fair sample — they seem to have copied all the others, without even 
noticing the incongruities in the narrations that they were com- 
bining, or without having the least idea of regarding their sources 
with any critical attention. 

William's idea of the manner in which a history should be writ- 
ten was very different from this. In the first place, the scope of his 
work was much greater, including not only an account of the First 
Crusade, but of almost a century of French rule in the Orient. 
Instead of plunging in medias res, he went systematically to work, 
and gave, in the first place, a clear, well-arranged description of the 
state of things in the East, previous to the First Crusade, with a 
logical analysis of the causes leading up to that great movement. 
As to his sources, William states in his Preface, that Books L to XV. 
are based on oral communications of old people, on letters and other re- 
liable documents. He also states further, that he has used no previous 
authorities : " In hoc v^ro nullam aut Grsecara, aut Arabicam habentes 
prseducem scripturam, solis traditionibus instructi, exceptis pauds 
quae ipsi oculata fide conspeximus narrationis seriem ordinavimus." 

Notwithstanding this elaborate disclaimer, it is certain that 
William was acquainted with all previous histories of the Crusades. 
Yon Sybel, the learned German historian of the First Crusade, has 
amused himself by comparing William's history with those of Albert 
of Aix, Foucher of Chartres, Eaymond of Agiles, and Tudebodus, 
and has clearly demonstrated that William followed sometimes one.

sonietimes another of these authorities for the first half, at least, of 
his work. But this much must be said for him, that he followed 
with discrimination, always sielecting the author who, in his judg- 
ment, would be most likely to have gotten the conect account of an 
event, and always suppressing whatever, to his mind, savoured of 
exaggeration, or appealed too strongly to the credulity or superstition 
of his time — in a word, he weighed carefully his authorities, and 
strove to be painstaking, critical, and impartial 

When it came to the later period of his history — ^to that of his 
own tim,e — -^e was equally exacting in respect of the testimony of 
eye-witnesses, always, if possible, getting more than one account of 
an event of a transaction. His historical and geographical data are 
e9pecially accurate and good. He also seems to have some idea of 
the philosophy of history, aud tries to bring out clearly the relations 
of cause and effect in his narration of events. His style is excellent. 
Although using the Latin of the Middle Ages, it was founded on the 
best Latin models, with which, as we have already seen, he was 
thoroughly familiar. His matter is well arranged, and his sentences 
clear. His great fault is a certain striving after rhetorical effect 
He is fond of stately, well-sounding sentences, and fine phrases, which 
he employs with effect in his descriptions of battles aud sieges. The 
merits of a style of this kind are seen but dimly through the medium 
of 15th-century English, especially when we consider, that, often 
owing to mistranslation, or to paleographic errors, the long sentences 
which were so sonorous in Latin, have suffered a reductio ad ab- 
surdum, and have lost not only their pristine literary grace, but 
even their original meanings. Still, notwithstanding these draw- 
backs, no one can read Caxton*8 Oodeffroye of Boloyne^ translation of 
a translation as it is, without feeling the vigour, sincerity, and culture 
of its far-away author, whose character the learned Thomas Fuller 
long ago so admirably summed up, in the Preface to his Holy War : 

** He was a pious man, and an excellent scholar, skilled in all the 
learned Oriental tongues, besides the Dutch and French, his native 
tongue — a moderate and faithful writer : treasurer he was of all the 
money contributed to the Holy TFor, chancellor of his kingdom, 
employed in several embassies in the West; present at the Latenm 
Council, the acts whereof he did record ; cardinal he might have been, 
but he refused it ; in a word, unhappy only that he lived in that age, 
though that age was happy tiiat he lived in it"

V. The Life of Godfrey of Bouilloii. xxix 



V. GODFEEY OF BOUILLON. 

Godfrey of Bouillon is to us of the 19th century a very shadowy 
personage, known chiefly as ond of the leading characters in Tasso's 
Jerusalem Delivered^ and it would certainly not occur to us, were we 
called upon to name the world's greatest heroes, to place him high 
up in the list. 

As the dispassionate modem judge reads the histories of the 
First Crusade, it seems to him that there are half a dozen other 
princes at least who deserve as much consideration and admiration 
as Godfrey : the clever scheming Bohemond, the chivalrous Tancred, 
the impetuous Count of Toulouse, and even Godfrey's own brother, 
the sensible and energetic Baldwin, all, according to the records, seem 
to have done as good service ; all seem to have played as important 
a part, and to have distinguished themselves as much as Godfrey of 
Bouillon. But it is very evident that William of Tyre does not 
think so, nor does Caxton, nor any of the preceding or subsequent 
historians of the Crusades. 

Young, chivalrous, and sincerely religious, Godfrey of Bouillon 
seems from the very beginning of the First Crusade to have aroused 
the popular admiration, and to have been singled out from among his 
peers to become the subject of tradition, legend and poetry. In fact, 
by common consent he was regarded as the central figure of the 
Crusades ; and there is no doubt that Caxton only voices the general 
opinion of his time when he " stalls" him in "thyrde stalle of the 
moost worthy of Cristen men," and ranks him as the world's greatest 
hero since Arthur and Charlemagne. Of course, as is the case with 
all great men who live in an uneducated and uncivilized age, a series 
of traditions and legends soon grew up around his name. Even less 
than a hundred years after his death, at the time that William of 
Tyre wrote his history, these traditions and legends were widely 
spread. Over some of them the discriminating William shakes his 
head, in particular, wisely refusing to credit the story of the swan, 
which strangely enough, after having been brought from the East by 
Oriental story-tellers, had attached itself to the family of Bouillon. 
Of this very legend, William says, ^^ Ftaeterinus denique shidiose 
Iket id verum fuisse pluri7no7*um, astruat narratio cygni fabulaniy 
unde vtdgo dicitin\ semerUivam eis fuisse originem, eo quod a vera 
tndeatur deficere talis assertion*

Other traditions, equally false but more probable and natural, he 
accepts, and bravely incorporates in the interesting little sketch which 
he gives us of the life of Godfrey, in the ninth book of his history, 
when narrating the circumstances of the choice of the first king of 
Jerusalem. Indeed, late investigations have shown that much of 
the biogi-aphy of God&ey of Bouillon which has been regarded as 
authentic, is either without any foundation in fact, or has been 
obtained from unreliable sources. In the few pages following, I give 
a brief account of what is really known of the life of Godfrey of 
Bouillon. This account, although containing information regarding 
our hero's early life — from outside sources — yet on the whole follows 
William of Tyre, and fulfils the double purpose of giving a brief 
biography of Godfrey of Bouillon, and, at the same time, a short 
rSsumS of Caxton's book, from the point where Godfrey puts on the 
cross, to start for the Holy Land. 

Godfrey of Bouillon— or " Boloyne," as Caxton incorrectly calls 
him — ^was the second son of Eustache, count of Boulogne-sui^Mer, 
and Ida, sister of the hump-backed Crodfrey, duke of Lower Lorraine. 
William, following the authority of William of Malmesbury, makes 
Godfrey the eldest son of his parents, but Ordericus Vitalis and 
other contemporary historians state that he was the second son. In 
the life of his mother Ida (Ada Sanctorum, ad XIII April, p. 141), 
we find also that Godfrey is given as her second son. He was of 
most distinguished birth and lineage, as both his &ther and his 
mother traced their descent back to Charlemagne. Eustache and 
Ida had two other sons ; one older, named after his father, Eustache, 
succeeded to the estates and title of Count of Boulogne ; another, 
younger, named Baldwin, became king of Jerusalem after Godfrey's 
death. William of Tyre assigns to Ida a fourth son, named William, 
who remains at home with his mother, while his three brothers are 
fighting in the Holy Land, but no reliable authority for the truth of 
this statement has ever been found. Ida had no daughter, although 
tradition designates a sister of Godfrey of Bouillon as the unfortunate 
and ill-used wife of Henry lY. of Germany. 

The year of Godfrey's birth is not positively known, but its most 
probable date is 1060. His birth-pl^ce is- equally uncertain, some 
authorities stating that he was bom in Baisy, Bkbant, thus making 
him a German subject both by birth and adoption. Most of the 
later historians and biographers have, however, decided in favour of 
Boulogne-sur-Mer, in France, his father^s ancestral home. Here the

three boys were very carefully reared by their pions and intelligent 
mother, whose teachings seem to have had a life-long influence over 
them all. 

Godfrey, who at an early age was adopted by his childless uncle 
Godfrey, duke of Lower Lorraine, spent much of his childhood in 
Brabant, and at the age of seventeen succeeded to the March of 
Antwerp and all his uncle's allodial possessions. Among these was 
the family castle of Bouillon, from which he took his title, which 
curiously enough Caxton has altered into " Boloyue," confounding it 
evidently with that of his father and brother in France. The early 
manhood of Godfrey, up to the call for the First Crusade, as narrated 
by enthusiastic biographers, and repeated to a certain extent by 
William of Tyre, represents him already as a brilliant, irresistible 
hero. According to these traditions, Godfrey appears at the court of 
the Emperor of Germany, surrounded by glittering retainers. Henry, 
impressed by the stately manner and beautiful person of the youthful 
hero, inquires "Who is this noble-looking knight 1" and kisses him 
when he learns his name, twice on the chin and cheek. Then 
foUovirs a series of knightly deeds. Godfrey succours the poor 
orphan, protects the friendless, and fights a duel for part of his 
heritage unjustly claimed by a relative. He is chosen from all the 
German nobles to carry the banner of his emperor against Rudolph 
of Suabia, and kills this same Rudolph on the field of battle. Then 
comes the famous journey to Rome, where Henry besieges the Pope, 
and Qoditey^ after wonderful deeds of valour, is the first to enter the 
city. Here, tradition says, heated by battle, he drank too freely of 
wine, and was in consequence seized with a fever, which lasted until 
he put on the cross for the First Crusade, when he immediately 
became welL William of Malmesbury, who relates the story, states 
that Grodfrey had no return of his malady during all the exposures 
of the First Crusade, until Jerusalem was taken, and a Christian 
government thoroughly established ; then, his mission on earth being 
fulfilled, God permitted his fever to seize him again so violently, that 
in a few days he died of it All of these stories except the last are 
plausible, and probable enough, but we do not find authorities to 
confirm them. Godfrey's life up to the time of the First Crusade — 
as nearly as can be gathered from documents and authentic records — 
was that of an ordinary young knight of good family. He was 
courageous and upright, and occupied himself chiefly in protecting 
his possessions from powerful and greedy neighbours, and in attend-:

ing to his own affairs. His chief care seems to have been to advance 
to the best of his ability his own worldly interests ; and there seems 
to have been veiy little manifestation of religions enthusiasm, or 
indeed of those heroic qualities which were soon to develop him into 
a world-renowned hero, and obtain for him honours which the world 
esteemed as among the greatest that could be conferred upon mortal 
man. This much is really known of him. He had a quarrel with 
Count Theodore of Flammes, whom he took prisoner, and kept in 
durance vile for the rest of his life. When only seventeen, he was 
besi^ed in the Castle of Bouillon, just after his uncle's death, by 
Albeit count of Namur, and by the Bishop of Yerdun. Against 
this combined attack Godfrey defended his fortress with skill and 
energy. The lords of Bouillon up to 1076 were also counts of 
Verdun, but after this time. Bishop Theoderic wished to have the 
title and the property bestowed upon Albert of Namur. Godfrey 
naturally opposed this intention, and not only protected himself and 
thwarted their purpose, but laid waste the diocese of the Bishop, and 
harassed him and his ally in every possible way. That Godfrey did 
go to Borne, to aid the Emperor against the Pope, seems definitely 
established, and as a reward for his services, in 1089, Henry 
bestowed upon him the duchy of Lower Lorraine, which had been 
refused him after the death of his uncle. 

When the caU for the First Crusade came in 1095, from Urban 
II, at the council of Clermont, Godfrey decided at once to go, and 
set about his preparations with such energy that he was the first of 
the great princes ready to start, although his retinue was one of the 
largest, for under his standard were ranged 10,000 horsemen and 
80,000 infantry. At this time, it is certain that he had no idea of 
devoting his life to the conquest of Jerusalem, and no intention of 
expatriating himself for ever. He sold his castles of Stenay and 
Monzon to the Bishop of Verdun, with whom he seems to have been 
on good terms again ; he also mortgaged the Seignory of Bouillon to 
the Bishop of liege, but on the express condition that he himself, or 
three of his nearest heirs especially named, might buy the property 
back within fourteen years. The price fixed was 1300 silver marks, 
and three gold marks. This price is given by Gilles d'Arval. 
Ordericus Vitalis says that he received 7000 marks of silver for 
them, while Albert d'Aix makes it only 1500. The bishop had a 
great deal of difficulty in raising this large sum of money, and even 
went so far as to despoil the shrine of St. Lambert, the altar, the

pulpit, and the sacerdotal vestments, of their gold and precious 
stones, besides taking everytliing valuable that he could lay his 
hands on in the convents and monasteries of his diocese. 

The fact that Godfrey made a series of unusually rich donations 
to different churches and religious houses between the years 1090 
and 1096 is well authenticated. In 1090 the records show that he 
restored to the Abbey of Gorze, in the diocese of Mets, the church of 
St. Dagobert at Steuay. In 1096 he gave many large gifts to this 
same church in concert with his brother Baldwin. In 1094, in 
concert with his mother and brothers, he presented the church of 
Baisy to the monastery of St. Pierre at Bouillon. He also founded 
at Antwerp the chapter of St. Michel, transferred later to the church 
of Notre Dame. In 1096 he assigned five manors to the monastery 
of Afflighem, situated near Genappe ; and the same year the family, 
as a whole, gave the church of Genappe, with all its revenues, to the 
same monastery. Godfrey also gave the castle of Falkenstein to the 
church of Notre Dame at Verdun, and presented the chapter of St. 
Jervais^ at Maestricht, with an estate that he possessed on the 
Meuse. 

Godfrey's worldly and religious affairs thus being all put in 
order, as we see, he finished his preparations and started for the 
Holy Land in August 1096, with his brothers Eustache and Bald^ 
win. As for the oft-repeated statement that Godfrey was the officially 
appointed leader of the First Crusade, there is no truth in it. The 
Papal Legate, Bishop Adhemar of Puy, was the only person to whom 
any authority had in any sense been officially delegated ; but there 
was no one particular leader of this great movement in the strict 
sense of the word ; each great prince prepared his own outfit, and 
gathered his army, and set out, when and how it best pleased him. 
If Grodfrey has always been considered the central figure of the First 
Crusade, it is owing not to his political position, but to his moral 
influence and personal character, probably because it was instinctively 
felt that he, more than any other of the great princes, was in sym- 
pathy with the tendencies and inotives that called it into being. 

Godfrey's journey to Constantinople, which dty Adhemar had 
chosen as the rendezvous of aU the princes, was not an easy one. He 
found all the countries through which he had to pass excited and 
unfriendly, owing to the outrages which had been perpetrated upon 
their inhabitants by the undisciplined bands of common people that 
had preceded him. Following the Danube, he arrived peacefully

enough at the boundaries of Hungary. Here however he encoun- 
tered great difficulties, so that it took him the whole month of 
September to traverse that country. The first part of November he 
crossed Bulgaria, and finally reached Nissa, where he received friendly 
messages from the Greek emperor Alexis, which he accepted in good 
faith. When he came to Phillipopolis, however, he learned that 
Hugh of YermandoiB, brother of the king of France, who had pro- 
ceded him to Constantinople by another route, instead of bdng 
treated by the Greeks with the consideration due to his lofty rank, 
was held a prisoner by the Emperor. Indignant at this treatment, 
Godfrey — ^who had scrupulously refrained from molesting the inhabit- 
ants of the countries through which he passed — immediately gave 
his men licence to pillage the land. This summary proceeding soon 
brought tlie Emperor to his senses, and he begged Hugh's pardon for 
his imprisonment, and agreed to set him free as soon as the French 
aimy should arrive in front of Constantinople. Not being able to 
obtain his ends by force, the crafty Alexis then changed his tactics, 
and by flattery and gifts soon persuaded Hugh, who was a vain 
young prince, to take the oath of allegiance to him — ^hoping to induce 
all the otiier barons and princes to follow this example. Grodfrey 
was the next to arrive ; but on being summoned to swear fealty and 
obedience to the Emperor, he utterly refused to do so, exclaiming 
reproachfully to Hugh, who came to him a second time to persuade 
him to take this step, "What! you, a king's son, have become 
a slave also ! " But as the winter wore on, and Alexis showed him- 
self so unfriendly, Gkxlfrey began to fear that, unless this concession 
were made, they might be long delayed in their undertaking, or 
indeed be hindered altogether from going on to Jerusalem. Albert 
of Aix, who gives a fuller report of these n^otiations than William 
of Tyre, states that finally Gkxlfirey consented to become Alexis' li^e 
man, rather than bring about an open rupture with him, saying that 
he had not left home to overturn Christian kingdoms, but to get the 
Emperor's help in carrying Christian weapons against JerusalenL 
This matter being settled the barons and princes decided to leave 
Constantinople, and to continue on their holy journey. The first 
city of importance beyond Constantinople on Mussulman territory 
was Nicaea, the capital of Bithynia, then under the rule of Solyman's 
son David, sumamed Kilidge-Arslan, or the Sword of the Spirit 
This town, although strongly fortified, the Crusaders resolved to 
besiege. Godfrey fought valiantly, and performed wonderful deeds

of valour, but he was not successful as the director of this siege. 
Nothing was really accomplished before Nicaca until Bohemond, 
Prince of Tarentuni, arrived. He infused new life and energy into 
everything, and soon forced Kilidge-Arslan to surrender. 

In accordance with the oath that they had sworn at Constanti- 
nople, the Crusaders handed the city over to Alexis, on the 27th of 
June, 1097. Having rested themselves thoroughly, they set off again 
for Syria by way of Phrygia, Cilicia, and the passes of the Taurus. 
Very unwisely the army divided, the main body, under Godfrey, 
Baymond of Toulouse, Adliemar, and Hugh of Yermandois, crossing 
the plain of Dorylaeum, while a smaller force, commanded by the 
Duke of Normandy, Bohemond, and Tancred, turned off to the left. 
Kilidge-Ai-slan, after his flight from Nicaea, nothing daunted by 
his defeat, had collected an army of about 200,000 men, and had 
returned, hoping to retrieve his misfortunes. As soon as he learned 
of the division of the army of his opponents, he determined to 
attack the smaller body. A terrible slaughter ensued. The Sara- 
cens were on the point of gaining a complete victory, when the 
main army came up to the rescue, preceded by Godfrey and fifty 
knights, who had been too impatient to wait for their slower-moving 
companions. In a moment the situation was changed. The Saracens 
were thoroughly routed, and fled in every direction, leaving their 
tents and a rich booty to the victors. 

The Crusaders continued their route after their victory, through 
an arid and desolate country, suffering incredible tortures from 
hunger, thirst, and heat; and it was not until they arrived in 
Armenia that relief was obtained. Here Baldwin left the main body 
of the army in order to besiege Edessa, which seemed* to him too 
tempting a piece of booty to be left behind, while Godfrey and the 
other princes marched towards Antioch in Syria, which great and 
powerful city they realized must be taken before they could go on to 
Jerusalem. 

Bagi Sijan, a Seljoueide prince, was at this time Emir of Antioch. 
For several years the whole Mahommedan world had been convulsed 
by internal religious dissensions. The two parties, whoso heads 
resided respectively in Egypt and Bagdad, were struggling for the 
mastery in Palestine. Bagi Sijan,— or Baghistan, as he is called in 
French and English Chronicles, — ^who sympathized with the Fati 
mides or Egyptian faction, was absent from Antioch as the Crusaders 
approached, having gone with the princes of Aleppo and Jerusalem

against Emessa, which was occupied by the opposite faction. C)n 
hearing the news of the Christians' arrival, he speedily returned to 
Antioch, and realizing his danger, sent for aid in all directions, 
including even those foes against whom but the day before he had 
been arrayed in arms. 

The Crusaders, after some debate, decided to attempt the siege of 
Antioch immediately, and took up their position around its walls, 
notwithstanding the fact that they had not enough men to invest 
them entirely. This was a siege in which, strange to say, the 
besiegers suffered infinitely more than the besieged. Antioch was 
well provisioned, while the country round about had been so 
thoroughly pillaged and laid waste, that it was with extreme diffi- 
culty that the Christians could obtain the necessities of life. Added 
to this was the discomfort of a rainy season, so long continued that 
their very tents rotted over their heads. As a natural consequence of 
this state of things, a frightful epidemic broke out, which reduced 
their numbers with startling rapidity, and enfeebled and discouraged 
those who were left alive. It was not until spring returned, and 
better weather came, that anything like energy showed itself among 
the besi^ers. 

In all this trouble Godfrey bore himself like a Christian hero, 
suffering patiently with the others, and signalizing himself by deeds 
of valour and courage. One of his exhibitions of strength and 
bravery is reported in more than one of the old chronicles. A fleet 
of Genoese and Pisans having anchored in the port of St. Simon, the 
Crusaders, in all haste and joy, sent a body of men to receive the 
provisions and news that they brought, and to escort back to Antioch 
the sailors and carpenters who were to assist them in constructing 
besieging engines. As the little body of men returned, it was attacked 
and routed by a x>arty of Saracens, who were lying in wait for them. 
Godfrey, hearing of the engagement, hastened to the spot with a large 
detachment of men. Bagi Sijan, who was standing on one of the 
towers of Antioch, rejoicing over the defeat of the Christians, seeing 
his own men, in turn, in danger, sent a party out from the town 
to their assistance. The m^^ became general, and the fighting 
desperate on both sides. The Christian princes smote prodigious 
blows, and performed wonderful deeds of valour. Bobert of Nor- 
mandy split the head of one of his opponents to the shoulder with 
a single stroke, but Godfrey surpassed even thai A huge Saracen 
engaged with him, and shivered his shield with the first blow.

Godfrey, rising in his stirrups, calmly cut his adversary in two 
across the middle with one stroke, so that the upper half of the 
man fell to the ground, leaving the lower half still sitting on the 
horse. 

Thus for months the Crusaders invested Antioch, and at the end 
of this time would have been no nearer accomplishing their purpose 
than at the beginning, had not one Emir Feirus, as William of Tyro 
calls him, a renegade Armenian of wealth and influence in Antioch, 
turned traitor, and delivered the city into their hands, on condition 
that Bohemond of Tarentum should be its prince and ruler. Once 
inside the walls, the Christians, infuriated by the long resistance, 
and exasperated by their own sufferings, slaughtered the greater part 
of the inhabitants, young and old indiscriminately, as many as six 
thousand perishing in a single night. But Godfrey and the other 
princes had but a short time to exult over their success. It will be 
remembered that Bagi-S^an at the commencement of the siege sent 
to all the great Mahommedan princes for aid. To his appeal they 
did not turn a deaf ear; and only three days after the Christians 
entered Antioch, on the 6th of June, Kerboga, prince of Mosul, 
presented himself before its gates, with an army estimated variously 
at £rom 300,000 to 600,000 men, and the besiegers became in turn 
the besi^ed. On the horrors of that siege it Ib difficult to dwell 
It is enough to say, that after being shut up three weeks in a city 
stripped of provisions and stores of every kind, the Crusaders, 
rendered desperate by famine and misery, marched out against 
Kerboga and his army — headed by Godfrey and Tancred, and their 
foUow peers — decided to die by the sword rather than by disease 
and hunger. Inspired by their necessities, and uplifted by their 
religious faith, the weak and enfeebled men fought as only desperate 
men can fight, and were rewarded by complete victory. They 
remained masters of the field, while the vast army of Kerboga was 
scattered to the four winds of heaven. This battle was the end of 
any effective opposition to the onward march of the Crusaders; l^ut 
the hardships that they had endured seemed for the time to have 
quenched the ardour of the leaders of the army, for it was not until 
late in the following winter, after the repeated solicitations of the 
common people, that the princes and great barons could be persuaded 
to leave their jnivate expeditions against adjacent cities, and start on 
their way towards Jerusalem. Godfrey, Eustache, and Bobert of 
FLuddeis did not get under way until spring.

Their route lay along the sea now, through such a heautiful and 
fertile country, that notwithstanding the murmurs of the common 
people, who were impatient to reach their journey's end, the leaders 
could not resist the temptation to stop and lay siege to some of the 
wealthy towns near hy. Godfrey hesieged Gihel, while Eaymond of 
Toulouse attacked Archas. In this way some time was consumed, so 
that it was not until the end of May that the forces were all united 
again, this time, however, with a firm determination to let nothing 
hinder them from proceeding directly to Jerusalem. 

Sickness and war had made terrible havoc among their number, 
80 that of the hundreds of thousands who had started on this under- 
taking, scarce fifty thousand were now left The excitement was 
tremendous as they approached the Holy City, The last night, 
many of the men, unable to restrain their impatience, marched the 
whole night through, and at daybreak, June 10th, 1099, saw the 
walls and towers of Jerusalem rise up before them. Never before or 
since, in the history of the world, probably, has a scene of such 
intense emotion, on so large a scale, been seen, or have such transports 
of joy and reverence been witnessed. Strong, stalwart men, who 
had endured untold suffering and privations to behold this sight, 
sobbed aloud; some cast themselves upon their knees in prayer; 
others kissed the earth on which they stood, in an ecstasy of 
rejoicing. 

The Tery next day energetic preparations were made for the 
assault of the city. To each of the princes was assigned a portion of 
the walls, to invest. Godfrey, with his brother Eustache and his 
cousin Baldwin du Bpurg, occupied the north-west side, between the 
gate of Damascus and the gate of Jaffa, which included the spot 
most precious to them all, the inclosure of Mount Calvary, llie 
Saracens — well provisioned, and thoroughly prepared for a long siege 
— ^had not only stripped the country around of everything eatable, 
but had filled up all the wells and cisterns for a long distance, so that 
in a few days the besiegers suffered both from hunger and thirst. 
Nothing daunted, they continued their siege with all the fire of 
religious enthusiasts; and recognizing the fact that their unaided 
strength could not accomplish their purpose, they set themselves 
systematically and patiently about building the necessary engines for 
making a decisive attack. For weeks they laboured untiringly, until 
at length everything that the military science of the time could 
devise, with the limited means and material at their disposal, was

V. The Life of Oodfrey of Bouillon. King of J&nisalenn, xxxix 

ready. On Thursday, July the 14tb, the assault was commenced. 
For two days the conflict was terrible ; both sides fought with the 
energy of desperation, until late on Friday afternoon, when the two 
brothers Lethold and Engelbert of Tournai, followed by Godfrey of 
Bouillon, set foot upon the walls of Jerusalem. In an incredibly 
short space of time Godfrey and his men were down in the city, and 
the gates were thrown open. The Crusaders massacred their enemies 
without mercy, and blood ran in torrents to their knees in tlie 
street 

But Godfrey, with his deep religious sentiment, felt that prayer 
rather than bloodshed befitted their first hours in Jerusalem, and set 
the example to the others by withdrawing from the carnage, and 
going barefooted, dad simply in a clean linen garment, to the 
sepulchre of our Lord, to return thanks that He had thus allowed 
them to accomplish their pilgrimage and fulfil their vows. Godfrey 
was followed by all \ weapons and bloody garments were laid aside, 
and barefooted, with heads reverently uncovered, all nmrcheil to the 
Church of the Eesurrection, weeping tears of joy, praying and singing 
bougs of penitence and rejoicing. 

The victory now obtained was complete, but there was no time 
to sit idly, or even to rest after their long labours. The city was 
cleared of its dead ; and after that^ the first care of the Crusaders was 
to organize a Christian government, and above all to choose a fitting 
ruler, a man capable of leading them in war, and of controlling and 
guiding them in peace. After due deliberation and careful inquiry 
into the character and ability of each of the great barons, on July 
23rd they elected Godfrey of BouiUon king of Jerusalem, and would 
have proceeded immediately to crown him, had not that pious and 
reverential prince unconditionally refused the honour. Their leader 
and duke he was willing to be, '' but God forbid," said he, " that I 
should be crowned with a crown of gold, where my Saviour bore a 
crown of thorns." At least, this is the report of the deliberations 
and their result, as given by William of Tyre, who followed Albert 
of Aix. According to Baymond of Agiles, the crown was first offered 
to Baymond of Toulouse, who refused it in the words here attributed 
to Godfrey. Other authorities state that the crown was also offered 
to Bobert of Normandy, who in turn refused it, and that then the 
choice fell upon Godfrey of Bouillon. Whether thia be true or not, 
it is certain that the choice once made, all were unanimously pleased 
and contented with it ; the common people, especially, regarded it as

the result of an inspiiation fiom heaven. Little opportunity was 
oiTered for festivities in honour of the new king^ as an Egyptian 
army, 300,000 strong, under the Emir Afdal, was advancing against 
them. So confident of victory were the Moslems, that they were 
even hringing with them, it was reported, ropes or chains with 
which to bind their prisoners. At the moment that Godfrey took 
command of the little army of the Crusaders, the enemy were already 
traverding Gaza, the ancient land of the Philistines. He sent im- 
mediately for Tancred and Eustache, who were away in Naplouse, 
and prepared to go out against the foe, as he saw that to allow them- 
selves to be besieged in Jerusalem would only repeat the horrors of 
Antioch* At first, Eobert of Normandy and Raymond of Toulouse 
refused to join the outgoing troops, but soon, seeing the imminent 
danger that threatened them, yielded, and united with the others. 
The two armies met near Askalon, Godfrey at the head of scarce 
20,000 men. But such was their enthusiasm and bravery that 
nothing could withstand them, and the vast army of Afdal was 
gloriously routed. This battle firmly established the Latins in 
Palestine ; and the great princes, feeling that they had fulfilled their 
vows, started one after another for home, leaving Godfrey with a few 
thousand men to solve the difficidt problem of governing, protecting, 
and increasing his newly-founded domain. 

Of the events of Go<ifrey*8 reign there is but little to say. Ho 
ruled wisely, strengthening himself in every possible way, and 
making good laws both ibr the governing and the governed. He 
died after one short year of kingship on July 18, 1100, and was 
buried on Mount Calvary, near the Saviour whom, in life, he had 
striven with reverence and single-heartedness to serve. Tradition 
gives us more than one version of the cause of his deatL One 
authority tells us that he died from eating some poisoned fruit, 
presented by the neighbouring Emir of Csesarea ; another states that 
he was poisoned by Dagobert^ the new bishop of Jerusalem; but 
neither of these two stories seems to be any more reliable than the 
quartan-fever l^end already mentioned. 

Thus perished, in the flower of his age, the man who above all 
others was the leading figure in the great religious movements of the 
11th and 12th centuries. 

Caxton's reasons for presenting the English-speaking and reading 
world with a translation of William of Tyre's history, he gives us 
in his simple preface. He wishes to arouse his <K>untrymen to a

renewed interest in the Holy Land, and above all to make them 
familiar with the noble deeds and ''hye cburageons faytes^' of 
Godfrey of Bouillon. As Godfrey disappears from the pages of 
William's history at this point, so Caxton abruptly ends his transLi- 
tion, without other comment than the date when the work was 
finished. It may be wondered that Caxton makes no mention of 
William of Tyre, either in his preface, or at the close of the book ; 
but there is no reason to believe that he, any more than the other 
editors and translators, knew who the real author of the work was, 
the identity of these editions and translations with the Latin text of 
William of Tyre, being a discovery which it was reserved for modem 
scholars to make.

NOTES. 



Note 1, p. 4. ThiB Edward was Edward IV., who died April 9th, 1483. 

Note 2, p. 6. "Afy lord Frynee and my lord By chords due of yorke oAid 
norfclkej* mentioned here by Caxton, are the two young princes who were su 
cruelly murdered in the Tower by Richard III. in 1483. 

Note 3, p. 19. William here gives the story of tlie capture of the Cross as 
believed in his time, and still received by the Catholic Church ; Chosroes' trophy, 
however, was not the whole of the Cross, as only part of it was left in Jerusalem 
by the Empress Helena, at the time of its discovei^. The rest wos sent to Con- 
stantinople, when it was again divided, one half being inserted by Constantino in 
the head of a statue of himself^ while the other half was sent to Rome and deposited 
in the church Santa Croce, in Gerusalemme, which received its name from the 
sacred relic. In 614, Chosroes carried off the piece that had been left in Jerusalem 
to his capita], Ctesiphon ; fourteen years afterwards, in 628, Heraclius brought it 
back. The feast of the Elevation of the Cross still commemorates the day of its 
restoration. 

Note 4, p. 19. The Cosdroe of William of Tyre is Cliosroes, or Khosru II., 
called Farviz iht Conqueror^ who ascended the throne in 590, in the midst of u 
civil war, and was assisted in maintaining his position by Mauritius, Emperor of 
Rome. When Phocas killed Mauritius in 602, and seized the- imperial power, 
Chosroes decided to avenc^e his ally, and attacked Phocas, taking Jerusalem m 614. 
Heraclius, who succeeded Phocas as emperor, invaded Persia in return, and con- 
quered Chosroes, who was killed soon after, on the 29th of Feb., 628, but by tlie 
hand of his own son. William's authority for his version of the whole story was 
the Arabian Said Ibn Baktrik. 

Note 6, p. 20. William refers here without doubt to Zacharias, patriarch of 
Constantinople, who was at ^lis time taken prisoner, and carried into Persia by 
Chosroes. Theophanes of Byzantium tells us in his CKronoaraphia, that tliis 
Zacharias was a contemporarv of St John of Alexandria, called Eleeinosynarius, — 
the St John Elymont from which the church in Jerusalem was named. According 
to Theophanes, Zacharias himself brought back tlie Cross from his captivity, and 
died soon after. According to others, Modestus, the successor of Zacharias, was 
patriarch when the CVoss was reinstated. The Catalogue of Nicephorus states 
that Zacharias was bishop (or patriarch) from 609 to 631, which would give him 
tliree years after his return from captivity in 628. 

Note 6, p. 22. This is the great and famous hero of the Arabian Nights of our 
childhood, Haroun al Raschid, or Ressit His name is more properly Hariin er 
Rashid, Aaron the Orthodox, He was the fifth of the Abasside Cahphs of Bagdad, 
was born at Ray, Feb. 15th, 766, and died in 808. He was the most accomplished, 
eloquent, and generous of all Mohammedan princes. Ascending the throne ut the 
age of twenty-two, he soon ruled the greater part of tlio Eastern world. The

account of his relations with Qiarlemagne Las, however, no trustworthy historicnl 
basis. 

Note 7, p. 24. Hyart, the Idraot of Tnsso's Jeniaalem Ddivercdy a prince of 
Damascus, and uncle of Annida, whom Tasso sends to the camp of the Christians 
to seduce their chiefs. 

Note 8, p. 36. According to Paulin Paris, the first church of St Mary de la 
Latyne was constructed between 1014 und 1023, by some Amaliians, pemjission 
having been granted them by the Sulian of Egypt It was built near Uie churcJi 
of the Holy Sepulchre, in the street of the Paumiers, and was called Latyne^ because 
the Latin instead of the Greek rites were used : a monastery was addetl to it to 
receive the pilgrims, and a hospital for the sick. Godfrey of Bouillon and others 
gave it large doi!ations. This whs the origin of the Knights Hospitallers of the 
order of St John of Jerusalem, called later Knights of Rhodes and Malta. 

Note 10, p. 37. For this conversation between Peter and Simeon there is no 
historical authority. It is not found in any of the known sources, and seems to 
have been introduced by William for rhetorical effect 

Note 11, p. 40. This Gilbert (who is known in history as the Anti-Pope) held 
the Seat from 1080 to 1101, under the title of Clement 111., but has never been 
numbered among the legitimate popes. 

Note 12, p. 47. This OatdUer wWumt knotoUche is called in English Walter 
the Pennyless, his French title l>eing not Oautier sans Savoir^ which Cazton 
translates Oavltier without knotdechey but Gcmtier saiis Avoir, P. Paris says that, 
far from being a term of reproach, the title Saiis Avoir was often applied to sons 
of noblemen to distinguish tliem from their older and wealthier brothers : Albert 
of Aiz calls him WaUerus cognomento Ztfizavehor; Tudebodiis, Chualteritis sine 
habere; Foucher of Chartres, Chialteritis ainepecimia; Foulques d'Anjon. (hiaUerius 
9ine Avero ; and William of Tyre, WaltoHus sine Habere, The Dictionnaire dee 
Oroisadesj Mi^ne, tome 18, says that his true name was Gantier de Perejo, tliat 
he was a nephew of Gautier de Perejo, who died en route for the Holy i^ud in 
Bulgaria. Gautier sans Avoir succeeded his uncle in command of 15,000 men, 
who witli eight knights formed the advance guard of Peter the Hermit Gautier 
was killed in 1097, during the siege of Nicsea. 

Note 13, p. 64. These speeches of the Grecian ambassador to Peter are quoted 
almost verbatim by William from Albert of Aiz. 

Note 14, p. 56. Soliman, son of KimtuI Misch, and a direct descendant of 
Seljuk, passed into Asia Minor in 1074, at the head of an army of Turks, carrying 
his conquests as far as Nicsea. His eldest son, Kilidge Arslan, called also SoUman 
the Younger, and David, is the Sclymam, here mentioned. William of Tyre makes 
him a nephew of the Soudan of Persia, and confounds the father and son. 

Note 15, p. 62. There was at this time a univeisal uprising against the Jews, 
especially in Gennany, due, without doubt, to the general state of exaltation. 
At Spiei-Q, Wonns, and Treves, as well as at Cologne und Mayence, there were 
terrible massacres, at least a thousand being slain in Mayence alone. In England 
the feeling was also very bitter against them, and notwithstanding Richard's efforts 
to protect them, large numbers were slain in Lincoln, Stamfora, and Lynn, and 
also in York after Richard's departure. 

Note 16, p. 79. Cazton's Eniyaes is a comiption for Eutyches, founder of the 
sect of the Eutychians, presbyter and archimandrite at Constantinople. He afiSrnied 
that after the union of the two naturea, human and Divine, Clirist had only one 
nature, that of the Incarnate Word, and tliat therefore His human bodv was 
essentially different from other human bodies. At the Council of Chalcedon, in 
451, this theory was declared heretical, and it was affirmed that two natures were 
united in Christ, but without any alteration, absorption, or confusion. Eutyches 
died in exile.

biahop of Alexandria, from 444 to 464. He also waft condemned for heresy at the 
(Jlialcedon Council. 

Note 18, p. 96. Belphet is known in Oriental history as Alp Arslan, Sultan of 
Persia, boni in 1030. He was celebrated for his justice, his cournge, and his 
generosity. His features were noble and fine, and his character gentle and good. 
His glory and power were so great that he is said to have had at one time 1,200 
subject princes around his throne. 

Note 19, p. 116. Without doubt Caius Julius Solinus, a Latin historian and 
granimnrian of the third or fourth century, author of a book called CdUcta/nea 
BerumMemorabiliumy a collection of the memorable things to be found in diiferent 
countries. His work is divided into seventy chapters. The best ancient edition 
is that of Salmasius, the best modern, that of Monnnsen, Berlin, 1864. He lived 
after the time of Pliny, and copied him so closely that he is often called Pliny's ape. 

Note 20, p. 12*2. Guynevers is a corruption of Guinemers, as can be seen from 
the Latin form of the word, GuiThemerus, 

Note 21, p. 124. William has made a mistake in his statement in respect to 
Rages. Ihis is not the Rages where Tobias went for the money of Gabael, as that 
city is in Persia, five miles south-east of Teheran. 

Note 22, p. 126. The name of this Greek prince, who ruled Edessn, was 
Tlieodore. It is given thus in tlie history of Matthew of Edessa. 

Note 23, p. 148. Latyns, a corruption for Tntinus or Estatin, called Tatinus 
tlie Noseless. He was a prefect of the palace of the emperor of Constantinople ; 
Aona Conmenus calls him Tatikios, and says that he was a Saracen by birth. He 
is called Tatice L'Esnas^ in the Chanson d'Aiitioche. 

Note 24, p. 162. When the Crusaders arrived in Asia Minur, the situation of 
the Mohammedans was exceedingly favourable for the accomplishment of their 
purpose ; all was confusion, and civil conflicts prevailed everywhere ; the power 
of the Seljukes was greatly broken, several pretenders were quarrelling for the 
Sultan's throne, and the emirs or governors of provinces, having made themselves 
independent, were waging war with each other. Several subject Christian princes 
— Armenians — had risen in arms in Taurus, and on the banks of the Euphrates in 
Mesopotamia. On the south, the Caliph of Egypt had just commenced a general 
war against the Seljukes, and was advancing towards Palestine. The Emir of 
Nicsea was fighting against the Prince of Mitilene ; the Emir of Aleppo was 
besieging his neighbours of I)ania8cns and Emessa ; and the Emirs of Sebasta and 
Mosul were engaged in war with the Annenian leaders, who were awaiting the 
arrival of the Crusaders with great inipatien«''e. For a further account of the 
situation, see von Sybel's Ckschwhte des Ersten Krewmufes, 

Note 26, p. 167. Steven paid deaily for this dtsert.on of the Holy Cause ; and 
although he arrived safely in France, was so reproached and condemned by botli his 
subjects and his wife, that he was forced in onier to satisfy public opinion, and to 
retrieve his character, to return to the Holy Land and fulfil his vows. He shared 
the misfortunes and perils of the Lombard, German, and French pilgrims, who 
were led by tlie Archbishop of Milan, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Duke of 
Bourgogne. Arriving safely in Antioch, he was received by Taocred, and went on 
to Palestine, where he was killed in 1102 at the battle of Ramla. Willmm, in 
recountinfi^ his death, observes that God had permitted him by a glorious death to 
atone for his previous sin and cowardice. 

Note 26, p. 189. Some of the most influential men departed in this way, by 
night; among tliose that are not given by name were Lambert le Pauvre, son of 
CoDon of Montaigne, and Godfrey's own nephew, Guillaum de Grantemesnil, Aubery 
his brother, Guillaume Charpentier, and Guy Trosselle. They were called hereafter 
the rope-runners, or funamhidiy in derision, and were regarded as most ignominious 
cowards and sinners: William refused to name them, because they were blotted 
out of the LamKs Book of Life for ever.

316 Notes. 

Note 27, p. 190. Chiy Croseaulx, a corruption of Guy Trosseaulx, or Guy 
Trosselle. 

Note 28, p. 201. William follows Raymond of Agilea in bis story of the finding 
of the lance, who tells of infinite signs and wonders from heaven. As usual, 
William omits the greater part of tliese, and speaks very cautioiitily of the whole 
inatter: he evidently is not a great believer in miracles. All of the different 
historians mention this miracle. Paulin Paris, in a note to his edition of William 
of Tyre, speaks of an early tradition that the lance witli which St Mercury pierced 
Julian the Apostate was preserved in the crypt of this church of St. Peter. 

Note 29, p. 202. This man, who accompanied Peter the Hennit to Kerbogha, 
is called in French Herluin. He can speak Turkish, and Tudehodus calls him 
DrogomanduB. Albert of Aiz does not mention him, because he wishes Peter to 
have all the honour of the embar>sy. 

Note 30, p. 211. This is not siipposed.to have been the real Greek fire, as used 
in ancient times in the Levant William says, " Et ignemy solito excutienUs oflrU" 
ficiOy 9ubj%ciunt in stipxdamy" they simply set fire to the bundles of hay, and made 
a dense smoke. 

Note 31, p. 219. Monsieur Littrd, in his dictionary, accepts this origin of the 
word hoMird. It did not come, however, from William of Tyre> but is an inter- 
polation of some French translator, who put in ** Sachiez que Id fu trovez et deUt 
vint U jeiu des dez q%ii eintvnt a non." 

Note 32, p. 233. This Cham, or Cbywi, as other French editions give it, is our 
Ham: Ghanaan is ni^turally his son Canaan, and Aracheus is the son of Canaan, 
who is called in our English Bible the Arkite. The Latin version of William of 
Tyre states that he was the seventh son, septirMtsfiliorum Chanaa/n, 

Note 33, pp. 238, 280. There seems to have been a difference of opinion as to 
this Arnold of Robes or Roches. William of Tyre dislikes him, and loses no oppor- 
tunity of speaking slightingly of him, in this agreeing with Raymond d'Agiles and 
TAbb^ Guibert ; for a rehabilitation of his character, see Description des Tambea/ux 
de Godefroid de Bouillon^ etc., by the Baron de Hody, Bruxelles, 1866. 

Note 34, p. 281. Mistranslation by Caxton, which is very curious. The French 
reads, " Ainz demandads des peintures et des iwrrt^w, aux ders et aas provoires^ 
Muut oois voUntiers Us estoires, et Us vies des sain» et irop etUendoit,** This last 
sentence is not in the original Latin, but was interpolatecf by some French trans- 
lator. As can be easily seen, it was the paintings and the stained windows, not 
the painters and ^aaiersy that he desired, and he sat a long time listening to the 
stones and lives of the saints. Paulin Paris remarks that this passage proves the 
early use of stained glass.

Original and Eocira Seiies Books, 1893-6. 3 

Fcbmary 1893. For this year the Original-Series Texts were issued in 1892, and so was 
one of the Extra-Series Texts. The other. Dr. Mary Colvin's edition of Caxton's Godfrey of 
BoloynCy is just ready. The Texts of both Series fcr 1894 and 1895 are almost sure to bo 
issued iu 1893. Members are askt to send their two- or three-years' subscriptions for 
both Series at once in advance. 

The Original-Series Texts for 1893 are :— No. 100, Capgrave's Life of St. KatJuirtJUy the 
text edited oy Dr. C. Horstmann, with Forewords, side-notes, and a discussion of Cliauccr's 
gh and Shakspere's long t, by Dr. F. J. Fumivall ; and No. 101, the Cursoi' Mundi^ Part VII 
and last, an Eissay on the MSS. of the Poem, their Dialects and Relation, &c, by Dr. H. Hupe. 

The Extra-Series Texts for 1893 are— No. LXIII. Thomas h Kempis*s De Imitatioius 
Christi, englisht : the first three books from the MS in Trinity College Dublin, about 1440 
A.D., and from Dr. Wm. Atkynson's version, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1502 ; and 
the fouitli book by Ma^aret, Countess of Richmond and Derby, Mother of Henry VII ; 
the whole edited by ProL J. K. Ingram, LL.I). No. LXIV. Dr. Mary N. Colvin's edition 
of Caxton's Godfrey of Boloyne, or Last Siege of Jerusalem, a.d. 1481. 

During 1892, two unexpected sources of help to the Society sprang up. First, Mr. Henry 
littlehales of Bexley Heath, who had printed a MS of the English Prymer, ab. 1400 a.d., 
kindly offerd to copy, and pay for the setting', not only of the Cambridge University MS of 
the Prymer, ab. 1425 a.d., but also of a series of extracts from the Rochester Diocesan Reg- 
isters, illuslrating the religious condition and social life of the diocese. The Prymcr or Lay 
Folk's Prayer-book is nearly all in type, and will form a valuable portion of the Society's 
Pre-Reformation vernacular Liturgical Series, undertaken on the recommendation of the late 
Canon Simmons. The Extracts fi-oni the Rochester Diocesan Registers are nearly half copied, 
and will go to press soon. Mr. Littlehalcs has also put himself generally at the Society's 
service, and has copied half of the Salisbury Cathearal MS of that very quaint treatise, 
Jacob's Well, about the middle of the 15th centnry. Mr. Littlehales means also to copy and 
edit for the Society the veiy interesting and life-like Diary of Canon Moore of "Worcester, 
1518-36, besides The Pore Caitiff, &c, &c. 

The second premise of help conies, most gratifyingly, from the Univei-sity of Chicago. Two 
Professors in the English Department there, Mr. MacClintock and Mr. Oscar Triggs— with the 
assent of their Principal, Dr. Harper— -agi*eed to edit and laint at the Chica^ University 
Press, two Early English Texts to be issued jointly by the University and the E. E. T. Society, 
the Society paying for its electrotypes. Prof. MacClintock chose the theological collection 
of John Lacy of Newcastle, a.d. 1434 (see p. 10 below), and Prof. Triggs chose Lydgato's 
Assembly <f the Oods. They hope that,Siotwithstanding their great World s Fair, these Texts 
will be issued in 1898. 

Such relief as the E. E. T. Soc gets from the above-named helpers will be devoted to its 
Reprinting Fund. The out-of-print Texts for 1866 are greatly wanted by members and 
collectors to complete their sets of the Society's publications. 

An urgent appeal is hereby made to Membera to increase the list of Subscribers to the 
E. E. Text Society. It is nothing less than a crying scandal that the Hellenic Society 
should have nearly 900 members, while the Early English Text Society has only a few 
over 300 1 

The Original Series Texts for 1894 will be— 1. Part I of Dr. R. von Fleischhacker's edition 
of the englisht Lanfraiic's Cirurgie, about 1400 A.D., a treatise perhaps more valuable for 
Dictionary purposes tlian any yet issued by the Society, which takes up to Chaucer's death 
the whole class of surgical and medical woi-ds (besides many others of common speech) which 
we befoi-e had only from the black-letters of Queen Elizabeth's time. The Editor has 
collated the English text ^vith its Latin ; and he shows how largely our first printed 
Aivatomie (Vicary's) is borrowd from it. Dr. von Fleischhacker hopes to be in England 
again next summer, and then to finish Part II. 2. The Prymer or iay Folk's Prayei'-book 
above-named, edited by Mr. Henry Littlehales. 

The Original-Series Texts for 1895 and 1896 will be chosen from books already at 

i>ress: Richai-d Misyn's — he was Prior of lincoln — englishings in 1434 and 1485 of 
lichard RoUe of Hampole's Fire of Love and Mending (^ Life, edited by Robert Harvey,. 
M.A., Headmaster of the Cork Grammar School; Lydgate and Burgh's Secrees of Philo- 
soffres, c. 1440, edited by Robei*t Steele, B.A. ; Mr. Gollancz's re-edited Fxeter-Book — 
Anglo-Saxon Poems from the unique MS. in Exeter Cathedral — Part I, of which the Text, 
with a modem englishing, has been long in type. Miss Pemberton has nearly fiuisht her 
edition of the fraginents of Queen Elizabeth's englishings (in the Record OflBce) from Boethius, 
Plutarch, &c. Prof. Napier has in type a 12th-century Homily on the Legeiid of the 
Cross, with an Introduction en the different Legends about it, together with an incomplete 
Chester Hymn to the Virgin of the 13th century, and a short Paper on the soft and hard 
g's of the Onnulum MS., with a facsimile. Dr. Fumivall's edition of the Lichfield Gilds is 
also all printed, and waits only for the Introduction, which Prof. £. C. K. Conner has

kindly undertaken to write for the book^ Prof. Mead has sent to press the completion of the 
prose Merlin, for which the Society has been looking in vain from its Treasurer since 1870. 
Miss Mary Bateson has at press George Ashby's Adive Policy of a Prince, &c., from the nniqne 
MS, A.D. 1468. Mr. Utley is home from Roumania, and promises to finish Lyndcmy'a 
Works this year. Dr. 6. Herzfeld's re-edition of the Anglo-Saxon Martyrology is all in type. 
Part II of Dr. Holthausen's Vices and Virtues needs only its Glossary. 

Mr. Steele has in type two prose englishings of the Seereta Seeretorum from MSS. at 
Lambeth, the second of which is very rich in new words. A version by James Yonge in 
1428, made for the Earl of Ormonde, will be copied from its Rawlinson MS. at Oxford, and 
collated with the later Lambeth MS. All three versions differ widely in contents and words. 

The Texts for the Extra Series in 1894 and 1895 will be chosen from the third and last 
Part of Prof. Dr. E. Kolbing*s edition of Sir Bevis offfampton — which he promises by Easter 
for the London University autumn B. A. examination ; — the Parallel-Text of^the only two MSS. 
of the Owl and Nightingale, edited by Mr. G. F. H. Sykes (at press) ; the prose Romance 
of Melusine, edited from the unique MS. by Mr. A. K. Donald (text all printed) ; The Three 
Kings' Sons, edited from its unique MS. by Dr. Leon Kellner (at press) ; The Toumeley 
Plays, re-edit^ from the unique MS. by Mr. Geoi^iEnsland and A. W. Pollard, M.A.; 
Part II of The ChetAer Plays, re-odited from the MSS., with a full collation of the formerly 
missing Devonshire MS., by Mr. G. England (at press); Hoccleve's englishing of De Regimine 
Prindpum, 1411-12, edited by Dr. Fumivall ; Deguilleville's Pilgnmage of the Life of Man, 
three prose versions — two English, one French— edited by G. N. Currie, M.A. Some of 
these Texts will be ready in 1893. Members are therefore askt to send Advanee 8ub- 
seriptions in 1898, for 1894 and 1895, in order that the 1894-5 books may be issued to 
them as soon as the editions are finisht. The Society's exnerience has shown that Editors 
must be taken when they are in the humour for work. All real Students and furtherers of 
the Society's purpose will be ready to push-on the issue of Texts. Those Members who 
care only a guinea a year (or can afford only that sum) for the history of our language and 
our nation's thought, will not be hurt by those who care more, getting their books in 
advance ; on the contrary, they will be benefited, as each successive year's work will then 
be ready for issue on New Tear's Day. Members are askt to realise the fact that the Society 
has now 50 years' work on its Lists, — at its present rate of production, — and that there is 
from 100 to 200 more years' work to come after that. The year 2000 will not see finish t 
all the Texts that the Society ought to print. 

Mr. G. N. Currie iis preparing an edition of the 15th and 16th century Prose Versions of 
GuiUaume de DeguiUeville s Pilgrimage of the Life of Man, with the French prose version 
by Jean GaUopes, from Mr. Henry Hucks Gibbs's MS., Mr. Gibbs having generously 

Sromist to pay the extra cost of printing the French text, and engraving one or two of the 
luminations in Ms MS. 

Guillanme de DeguiUeville, monk of the Cistercian abbey of (Thaalis, in the diocese of 
SenUs, wrote his fibrst verse Pelerinaige de VEomme in 1880-1 when he was 36.^ Twenly-fivc 
(or six) years after, in 1855, he revised his poem, and issued a second version of it, and this 
IS the only one that has been printed. Of the prose representative of the first version, 1830-1, 
a prose Englishing, about 1480 a.d., was edited by Mr. Aldis Wright for the Boxburffhe Club 
in 1869, from MS. Ff. 5. 80 in the Cambridge University Librar^r. Other copies of this prose 
EnffUsh are in the Hunterian Museum, GlWow, Q. 2. 25 ; Univ. ColL ana Corpus Christi, 
Osford' ; and the Laud Collection in the Bodleian, no. 740. A copy in the Northern dialect 
is MS. G. 21, in St. John's Coll., Cambridge, and this is the MS. which will be edited by Mr. 
Sidney J. Herrtage for the E. E. Text Sociebr. The Laud MS. 740 was somewhat condenst 
and modernised, in the 17th centniy, into MTS. Ff. 6. 30, in the Cambridge University Lib- 
rary:* "The Pilgrime or the Pilgrimage of Man in this World," copied by WilL Baspoole, 
whose copy "was verbatim written by Walter Parker, 1645, and from thence transcribed by 
G. G. 1649 ; and from thence by W. A. 1655." This last copy may have been read by, or 
its story reported to, Bunyan, and may have been the groundwork of his Pilgrim's Progress, 
It will be edited by Mr. Currie for the E. E. T. Soc., its text running under the earlier 
English, as in Mr. Herrtage's edition of the Oesta JRojnanorum for the Society. In Februanr 
14^1,^ Jean GaUopes — a clerk of Angers, afterwards chaplain to John, Duke of Bedford, 
Regent of France — turned Deguilleville's first verse Pelerinaige into a prose P^lerinage de la vie 
humaine.^ By the kindness of Mr. Hy. Hacks Gibbs, as above mentiond, Gallopes's French 
text will be printed opposite the early prose northern Englishing in the Society's edition. 
The Second Version of BQgoilltYilWs Pelerinaige de VEomme, a.d. 1855 or -6, was englisht 

1 He was bom about 1205. See Abbi Ooujbt's SiblialheqMfran^itet Vol. IX, p. 78^ -P. M.

ill verse by Lydgate iii 1426. Of Lvdgatc's x>oem, the larger imrt is iu the Cotton MS. 
Yitellius C. xiii (leaves 2-308). This MS. leaves out Chaucer s euglinhiug of Deguilleville's 
ABC or Prayer to the Virgin, of wliich the successive stanzas start with A, B, C, and run all 
thro' the alphabet ; and it has 2 gaps, of which most of the second can be fild up from the 
end of the other imperfect MS. Cotton, Tiberius A vii. The rest of the stopgaps must be got 
from the original French in Harleian 4399,^ and Addijtional 22,937' and 25,594' in the 
British Museum. Lydgate's version will be edited in due course for the Society. 

Besides his first PeUrinaige de Vhomvie in its two versions, DeguiUeville wrote a second, 
' ' de Tame separee du corps,'" and a t]iird, * * de nostre seigneur lesus. " Of the second, a prose 
Englishing ox 1413, The Pilgrimage of the Soxole (perhaps in part by Lydgate), exists in the 
Egerton MS. 615,^ at Hatfield, Cambridge (Univ. Kk. 1. 7, Caius), Oxford (Univ. ColL and 
Corpus), and in Caxton's edition of 1483. This version has ' somewhat of addicions ' as Caxtou 
says, and some shortenings too, as the maker of both, the first translator, teUs us in the MSS. 
Caxton leaves out the earlier englisher's interesting Epilog in the Egerton MS. This prose 
englishing of the Sowle will be edited for the Society after that of the Man is finisht, and will 
have Gallopes's French opposite it, from Mr. Gibbs's MS., as his gift to the Society. Of the 
pilgrimage of Jesus, no englishing is known. 

As to the MS. Anglo-Saxon Psalters, Dr. Hy. Sweet has edited the oldest MS., the 
Vespasian, in his Oldest English Texts for the Society, and Mr. Harsley has edited the 
latest, c. 1150, Eadwine's Canterbury Pfmlter. Dr. Logeman then raised the question 
of how the other MSS. should be treated ; and he was authorised to prepare a rarallel- 
Text edition of the first ten Psalms from all the MSS., to test whether the best way of 
printing them would be in one group, or in two — in each case giving parts of all the MSS. on 
one page — ^under their respective Itoman and Galilean Latin originals. If collation proves 
that all the MSS. cannot go together on successive pages, there will be two Pandlel-Texts, 
one of the A.Sax. MSS. following the Roman version, and the other, of those glossing the 
Gallican ; but every effort will be made to get the whole into one Paiallel-Text. This Text 
will be an extravagance ; but as the Society has not yet committed one in Anglo-Saxon, it 
will indulge in one now. And every student will rejoice at having the whole Pstdter material 
before him in the most convenient form. Dr. Logeman and Mr. Harsley will be joint editors 
of the Parallel-Text. The Early English Psalters are all independent versions, and will follow 
separately in due course. 

Through the good' offices of the Examiners, some of the books for the Earlv-English Ex- 
aminations of the University of London will be chosen from the Society's publications, the 
Committee having undertaken to supply such books to students at a lar^e reduction in price. 
The profits from these sales will be applied to the Society's Reprints. Five of its 1866 Texts, 
and one of its 1867, still need reproducing. Donations for tnis purpose will be welcome. 
They should be paid to the Hon. Sec, Mr. W. A. Dalziel, 67 Victoria Rd., Finsbury Park, 
London, K. 

Members are rt^inded thsit fresh Subscribers are always wanted^ and that the Committee 
can at any time, on short notice, send to press an additional Thousand Pounds' worth of work. 

The Subscribers to the Original Series must be prepared for the issue of the whole of the 
Early English Lives of Saints, sooner or later, liie Society cannot leave out any of them, 
even though some are dull. The Sinners would doubtless be much more interesting. But in 
many Saints' Lives will be found valuable incidental details of our forefathers' social state, 
and all are worthful for the history of our language. The lives may be lookt on as the 
religious romances or story-books of their period. 

The Standard Collection of Saints' Lives in the Corpus and Ashmole MSS., the Harleian 
MS. 2277, &c. will repeat the Laud set, our No. 87> with additions, and in right order. The 
differences between the foundation MS. (the Laud 108) and its followers are so great, that, to 
prevent quite unwieldy collations, Dr. Horstmann decided tliat the Laud MS. must be printed 
alone, as the first of the Series of Saints' Lives. The Supplementary Lives from the Vernon 
and other MSS. will form one or two separate volumes. 

Besides the Saints' Lives, Trevisa's englishing of Bariholonueus de Proprietatibus iZ^ntm, 
the mediseval Cyclopedia of Science, &c., will be the Society's next big undertaking. Dr. 
R. von Fleischhacker will edit it. Prof. Napier of Oxford, wishing to have the whole of 
our MS. Anglo-Saxon in type, and accessible to students, will edit for the Society all the 
unprinted and other Anglo-Saxon Homilies which are not included in Thoi*pe's edition of 
MIMc'b prose,' Dr. Morris's of the Blickling Homilies, and Prof. Skeat's of Yurie's Metrical

6 The Original Series of the " Early EnffOnh Text Society,^' 

Homilies. Prof. Kolbing has also undertaken for the Society's Extra Series a Parallel-Text 
of all the six MSS. of the Ancren MwU^ one of the most important foundation-documents of 
Early English. Mr. Harvey, too, means to prepare an edition of the three MSS. of the 
Earliest JEiiglish Metrical Psalter, one of which was edited by the late Mr. Stevenson for the 
Surtees Society. 

In case more Texts are ready at any time than can be paid for by the current year's in- 
come, they will be dated the next year, and issued in advance to such Members as will pay advance 
subscriptions. The 1886-7 delay in getting out Texts must not occur a^in, if it can possibly 
be avoided. T]ie Director has in hand for future volunteer Editors copies of 2 or 8 A^S. 

Members of the Society will learn with pleasure that its example has been followed, not 
only by the Old French Text Society which has done such admirable work under its founders 
Profs. Paul Meyer and Gaston Paris, but also by the Early Russian Text Society, which was 
set on foot in 1877> and has since issued many excellent editions of old MS. Chronicles &o. 

Members will also note with pleasure the annexation of lairare tracts of our Early English 
territory by the important German contingent under General Zupitza, Colonels £61bing and 
Horstmann, volunteers Hausknecht, Einenkel, Haenisch, Ealuza, Hupe, Adam, Holthausen, 
&o. &c. Scandinavia has also sent us Dr. Erdmaun ; Holland, Dr. H. Loceman ; IVance, 
Prof. Paul Meyer — with Gaston Paris as adviser ;— Italy, Prof. Lattanzi ; while America is 
represented by Prof. Child, Dr. Mary Noyes Colvin, Prof. Mead, Prof. Perrin, &c The sym- 
pathy, the ready help, which the Society's work has cald forth from the Continent and the 
United States, have been among the pleasantest expeiiences of the Society's life, a real aid 
and cheer amid all troubles and discouragements. All our Members are grateful for it, and 
recognise that the bond their work has woven between them and the lovers of language and 
antiquity across the seas is one of the most welcome results of the Society's efforts.
