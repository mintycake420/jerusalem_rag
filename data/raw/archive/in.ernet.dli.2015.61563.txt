PREFACE 


Von Sybel, writing in i88i, expressed his pleasure in 
the acceptance by scholars of that scientific recon- 
struction of the history of the First Crusade which he 
had given to the world forty years earlier, and his hope 
that in the course of another forty years the results of 
his researches would have penetrated into text-books 
and school-books.^ 

That hope is now in process of fulfilment, but the 
great Chronicles of the Crusades are still only accessible 
in scholarly editions which are too costly, too cumbrous, 
and too elaborate for the ordinary reader. 

This small edition of the ‘ primary authority ’ ^ for 
the history of the First Crusade, the anonymous 
Gesta Francorum ei aliomm Hierosolymitanorum, is 
specially designed for the use of students reading for the 
Prehminary Examination in Modern History in the 
Unive rsity of Oxford, but it is hoped that it may help 
to guile the feet of other pilgrims on the ‘ Way of 
the Holy Sepulchre ’, the iter Hierosolymitanum, for 
the little book forms an excellent starting-point for the 
study of the Crusading movement, and deserves to be 
more widely known. Of the three existing editions 
of the Gestu Fraficorurrij one is included in Eongars* 
Gesta Dei per Francos, published at Hanover in i6ii ;

PREFACE 

another appeared in 1866 in the third volume of the 
magnificent but bulky Recueil des Historiens des 
Croisades, Historiens occidentaux, published by the Paris 
Academic des Inscriptions. The third and most recent, 
Heinrich Hagenmeyer’s admirable and comparatively 
handy edition, Anonymi Gesta Francorum et aliorum 
Hierosolymitanorum, Heidelberg, 1890, is bewildering 
from the very completeness of its critical apparatus, its 
wealth of prefaces, notes, and variant readings. The 
present edition simply aims at producing a text-book 
which may serve as an introduction to the more learned 
works on the subject. Bongars’ text has been followed 
in spelling and in the usage, characteristic of the date 
of publication, of printing u and v as v initially and 
as u in other positions in small letters, and uniformly 
as V in capitals. Punctuation has been modernized, 
italics have been replaced by Roman type throughout, 
and small letters have in some cases been substituted 
for capitals. 

My grateful thanks are due to the Master and 
Fellows of Gonville and Caius College and to the 
ofi&cers of the University Library, Cambridge, for 
facilitating my collation of MS. C., to Miss C. M. Ady 
for kind assistance in proof-reading, and to Mr. W. H. 
Stevenson for valuable suggestions and corrections. 

The late Master of Balliol encouraged me to edit 
this book, which he first taught me to know. To his 
memory I inscribe it.

INTRODUCTION 

MANUSCRIPTS AND TEXT 

The mss. used by Hagenmeyer in his edition of the Gesta 
Francmm were classified by him in three groups. In the 
first group, BG, he placed B, a Madrid MS. of the early four- 
teenth century, and G, Bongars’ printed edition, which rests 
on two unidentified MSS. These two sources he regarded as 
probably nearest to the original text, since they are dis- 
tinguished by the crudity and awkwardness of their style 
and by their agreement with early plagiarists. He therefore 
based his own text on them wherever they agreed. When 
they differed, he gave the preference as a rule to the reading 
which most closely coincided with the text of the early 
plagiarists of the Gesta, especially Tudebod, who probably 
had access to the original manuscript . He gave the variant 
readings of all the other known MSS. except F, which is 
late and much abbreviated, and also the readings of iR, 
the Recueil edition.^ The Rectieil edition prints the Gesta 
Francorum under the title of Tudelodus (Mrmatus? It 
is based mainly on a twelfth-century Vatican MS., E, and 
on Bongars, with variants also from F, the one MS. not used 
by Hagenmeyer. MS. E is placed by Hagenmeyer in his 
second group DE, both Vatican MSS. of the twelfth century. 
In both there is a serious hiatus in the text (see foot-note, 
c. xxiii, 23), which also occurs in ff, a MS. of the third group. 

This third group, ACH, includes a twelfth-century MS., 
A, a MS. H, which seems to have once been at Kenilworth, 

‘ Hagenmeyer, G. F., Einleitmg, §§ 7, 8, pp. 92-8.

Viii INTRODUCTION 

and the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century MS. C, which is 
now in the library of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 
The remaining MS. F is also a Cambridge MS. now at 
Corpus Christ! College. It dates from the fourteenth 
century. The present edition is based on Bongars* text, 
with emendations from the MSS. and Tudebod, and 
with variant readings from representative MSS. of Hagen- 
raeyer’s three groups. B represents Group I, E Group II, 
and C Group III. The editions of Hagenmeyer and the 
Recueil have been carefully compared with Bongars 
for B and E variants, and Hagenmeyer’s collation of E 
has occasionally been altered in accordance with the 
Recueil, C has been re-collated from the original MS. 
Limitations of space have made it necessary to omit from 
the foot-notes such minor differences between the MSS. 
as variations in spelling, transpositions of words, and un- 
important changes in grammatical construction. Where the 
path is so well worn it is impossible to avoid treading in the 
footsteps of those who have gone before, and it would be 
absurd to sacrifice accuracy on the shrine of originality ; yet 
in a few cases the readings of the most recent and thorough 
editor, Hagenmeyer, have been rejected, though the reasons 
for such rejection- have been fuUy given in the notes. 

One possible source of error, perhaps of enlightenment, 
Hagenmeyer hardly notices. Bongars' printed folio edition 
of i6ii bears evidence of respect for the letter of his MS, 
sources, but it also suggests that he had some difficulty in 
reading them, or that their text was corrupt. Thus, while 
on p. 17 a lacuna is carefully marked by asterisks, on p. 58. 
occurs the obviously erroneous form Hugo Cli Forcemz, 
These points are noted as they appear in the text, as they 
have a definite critical value. In MSS. BE of the Gesta 
Francorum and in the printed editions of Bongars and the 
Recueil, the material is divided into four books of very

unequal length. If, as Hagenmeyer thinks is not impro- 
bable, the author himself is responsible for this arrange- 
ment, he probably failed to carry it beyond the ninth 
chapter. As, however, it was repeated by Bongars, it has 
been retained in this edition. 

The four books are further subdivided into eight sections, 
each of which ends with a doxology and Amen, in the 
following s^uence :

Each section marks a stage in the military history of the 
Crusade and closes with a military event, beginning with 
the battle on the Vardar and ending with the battle of 
Ascalon. Paulin Paris ^ suggested that these sections were 
of the nature of letters or ‘ war bulletins which would be 
sent to Europe, copied, and read for edification in the 
churches of the West, and afterwards worked up, with 
additional notes, into a book. Hagenmeyer ^ is more con- 
vincing when he treats the Gesta as a diary or journal, 
written in sections during intervals of leisure in the course of 
the war, while the events recorded were stiU fresh in the 
writer’s memory. 

THE BOOK AND ITS AUTHOR 

In the year 1608 Jacques Bongars, the French scholar- 
diplomatist, made a ' Platonical Voyage ’ to England, 
* whereof the chief occasion as we learn from a contem- 
porary letter to the English antiquary, William Camden,®

X INTRODUCTION 

was ‘ to see the Universities, and search our Libraries 
In i6ii he published two folio volumes of records of the 
Crusades, under the title of Gesfa Dei per Francos, sive 
orientalium expediiionum et regni Francorum Hierosoly- 
mitani historia. In 1612 he died, leaving his work unfinished. 
To Bongars' search in English libraries and to his friendship 
with Camden we probably owe one of the two MSS. on which 
he based the earliest printed edition of the anonymous 
Gesfa Francorum et aliorum Hierosolymitanorum, with which 
the Gesia Dei per Francos opens, for one of those MSS. was 
given to him by Camden, the other by the French savant, 
Paul Petau. Bongars regarded the Gesta Francorum as an 
original source, the w^ork of an Italian follower of Bohe- 
mund, and until 1641 this was the received opinion. In that 
year, in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Historiae Fran- 
corum Scripiores coaetand, appeared Besly's edition of the 
Historia de Hierosolymitano Itinere of Petrus Tudebodus, 
Pierre Tudeboeuf , Tudebode, or Tudebod, a French priest of 
Civray in Poitou, In his learned preface Besly maintained 
that Tudebod was the original authority, from whom the 
anonymous author of the Gesta had borrowed most of his 
material without acknowledgement. Besly 's view was 
almost universally, accepted, and held the field for about 
two centuries. Von Ranke was the first to throw doubt on 
it, while in 1841 von Sybel, in his epoch-making Geschichfe 
des ersten Kreuzzuges, followed by the investigations of his 
pupil Gurewitsch,^ reversed the decision of Besly, relegated 
Tudebod to the rank of a plagiarist, and restored the 
Anonymous to his pride of place as an original authority 
of the first importance. About the same time (1842) a 
Frenchman, de Saulcy,^ arrived independently at much the 
same results. Though the editors of the Recueil des

THE BOOK AND ITS AUTHOR xi 

Historiens des Cfoisades (1866) still clung to the old opinion 
and called the work Tudebodus abhreviatus^ they were in the 
minority. Von Sybel’s conclusions won general acceptance, 
and were fully borne out by Hagenmeyer's critical edition 
of the text, which was published in 1890. 

Besly’s argument for the priority of Tudebod rested 
mainly on certain passages in which Tudebod speaks of 
himself as an eyewitness, and as a writer, gives his name, 
and mentions his brother,^ who died on the Crusade. 
These passages are not found in the Gesta, and Besly 
accused the anonymous author of deliberately suppressing 
them. Von Sybel’s counter-argument, which is well 
summarized by Hagenmeyer, showed that the passages in 
question were interpolations, and urged the priority of the 
Anon3rmous on four main grounds : (i) he uses the first 
person throughout : Tudebod uses both the first and the 
third person ; (ii) the Anonymous was a soldier, and writes 
consistently in this character : Tudebod was a priest, and 
writes sometimes as an ecclesiastic, sometimes, following the 
Anonymous, as a layman ; (iii) Tudebod’s additions to the 
Gesta axe anecdotic and personal, and could be easily inter- 
polated, while his omissions of passages which occur in the 
Gesta are awkward and clumsy and interfere with the text ; 
(iv) Tudebod has used not only the Gesta, but the work 
of Raymond of Agiles, whereas the Anonymous has not 
incorporated a single passage from Raymond, though 
Hagenmeyer believes that both Raymond and his contem- 
porary Fulcher of Chartres have borrowed from the Gesta. 

The Gesta Francorum, then, the short, simply written 
record of an unknown soldier-pilgrim, is now recognized as 
one of the main sources from which the medieval historians

xii INTRODUCTION 

of the First Crusade drew their inspiration, a source whence 
the stream of Crusading literature began to flow even before 
the First Crusade was at an end. 

Among the direct plagiarists who copied the Gesta 
almost word for word, without acknowledgment of their 
debt, are Tudebod and, in a less degree, the anonymous 
twelfth-century Historia belli sacri. ^ In the reaction in 
favour of the Gesta, the real value of these authorities is in 
danger of being forgotten. Tudebod was, fairly certainly, 
himself an eyewitness of the First Crusade, and his additions 
to the text of the Gesta reflect his own experience. If he 
plagiarizes, he is the earliest of the plagiarists, and he may 
represent the original text better than some of the later 
copyists, who thought to improve the rude style of the 
Anonymous. The Historia belli sacri, too, which Mabillon ^ 
actually regarded as the source of Tudebod and of the 
Gesta, may often serve to establish a reading, or to clear up a 
textual difficulty. More subtle in their method of imitation 
are the writers of the first three decades of the twelfth cen- 
tury who mention the Gesta as their authority, but take 
credit to themselves for embellishing and elaborating the 
crude raw material with which they deal. Baudri, Arch- 
bishop of Dol, Guibert, Abbot of Nogent-sur- Seine, and 
Robert, the Monk of Rheims,® all speak of the little anony- 
mous book, with its rustic style, libellum . . . nimis rustica- 
num,^ on which their own more polished work is based. 

The influence of the Gesta Fmncorum can also be traced, 
though in a more indirect form, in the writings of such 
imitators and occasional borrowers as Raymond of Agiles,

THE BOOK AND ITS AUTHOR xiii 

Fulcher of Chartres, Ekkehard of Aura, who in iioi read 
at Jerusalem a little book on the Crusade, which may have 
been a copy of the Gesta^ and the versifiers Fulco and 
Gilo of Paris.2 Even the romantic and legendary sources, 
the Chanson d'Antioche and the romance of Godfrey de 
Bouillon, probably owe something to the camp gossip and 
the marvellous tales preserved in this unpretending con- 
temporary record, and thus it has passed into the pictur- 
esque pages of Albert of Aix, and has set its mark on the 
great Crusading history of William of Tyre. 

If the author of the Gesia must remain anonymous, he 
has at least unconsciously revealed himself in all but name 
in his book, and from that book Bongars, von Sybel, and 
Hagenmeyer have reconstructed his personality with 
scholarly care and insight. There can be no doubt that he 
was a layman and a soldier, presumably of gentle birth, 
since he served as a knight till poverty and misfortune 
reduced him to the ranks of the fedites? He was, in all 
probability, a southern Italian of Norman stock, for 
whom the practical and immediate knowledge of the 
Crusade began in connexion with Bohemxmd's division of 
the Crusading host, to whom Bohemund, that most 
valiant warrior, wise and prudent, dignified and honour- 
able, strong and unconquered, is the ideal leader, honor 
et decus totius mundi, bellorum arbiter et certaminum index, 
athleta Christi, and, for the anonymous chronicler himself,

dominus, the feudal lord,^ of whose farntdatus, or personal 
following, he seenis to have fornied part.® The cry of 
Deus vidi, which the French Crusaders first heard at 
Clermont, echoes for the Italian-Norman as Deus le volt, 
from the siege of Amalfi ; the crosses that his comrades 
wear are cut from the splendid cloak of his hero Bohe- 
mund ® The names of the petty princes of southern Italy 
are familiar to him, though he only knows the more im- 
portant leaders of the northern French army.* He uses 
Italian-Latin constructions and words, such as piscina, 
ienda, merula, and places the conquest of his modest 
home-land Apulia among the objects of ambition of the 
powerful Eastern prince Kerboga,® while he shows a more 
intimate acquaintance with both Byzantine and Saracen 
affairs than would be likely to be possessed by a French- 
man or even by a North Italian. To judge from his use of 
the first person and from the vividness of his descriptions 
of particular incidents, he took the cross at Amalfi in the 
summer of 1096, and crossed over to the Balkan Peninsula 
with the South Italian division later in the same year. He 
was present at the battle of the Vardar, encamped under 
Tancred's command outside Constantinople during the 
negotiations of the Crusading leaders with the Emperor 
Alexius, crossed the Bosphorus in the spring of 1097, 
went through the siege of Nicaea and the battle of Dory- 
laeum, and before the end of October 1097 had settled down 
to the siege of Antioch, in Bohemund’s camp, to the east of 
the city.® He took part in the plunder-raid of Bohemund 
and Robert of Flanders in the last days of 1097 ; he helped 
to build the fort opposite the Bridge Gate in March 1098 
and was in the fight of the 6th of March, when the Crusaders

drove the Turks over the bridge and defeated them with 
great slaughter.^ When in June 1098 the city was betrayed 
by Firouz, as one of the chosen band of Bohemund*s men 
who made the first attack, he was among those who 
entered Antioch by a postern gate.® When the Christians 
in Antioch were in turn besieged by the Turks he fought 
against Kerboga's army in the battle of June the loth, and 
worked at the wall which was to protect Bohemund's forces 
from the Turks who held the citadel. He was present in the 
church of St. Peter when the Holy Lance was found, and 
on June 28, 1098, in the final battle with Kerboga, he fought 
on horseback, pursued the flying Turks, and shared the 
rejoicings over the victory.® It was probably now that 
he wrote that graphic account of the siege which fills 
eighteen of the thirty-nine chapters into which his book is 
divided. In the late November of 1098 he accompanied 
Bohemund to Marra, but after the siege and capture of the 
town, instead of returning with his lord to Antioch, he 
seems to have joined the Provengal army and to have gone 
on to Jerusalem with the followers of Count Raymond of 
Toulouse. With them he experienced the siege of Area and 
the journey by the coast-towns to the Holy City. Here he 
fought, both in the attack on June 13, 1099, and in the final 
successful assault on June 15, when Jerusalem was taken 
by the Crusaders. The book ends with a lively description 
of the battle of Ascalon on August 12, 1099, and of the 
triumphant return to Jerusalem of the booty-laden Franks.^ 
The author of the Gesta was thus admirably fitted by 
position and experience to be a chronicler of the great 
expedition in which he played so active a part. As a knight, 
enjoying the privileges of the knightly status, he would

INTRODUCTION 


learn something of the policy of the leaders in their divided 
counsels. As a foot-soldier, during the later months of the 
Crusade, he knew the sufferings and the courage of the 
fauperes homines pedites. As a layman he stands out con- 
spicuously in the crowd of ecclesiastical chroniclers. Pre- 
judices he may have, but they are of another kind from 
those of the emotional Provengal priest, Raymond of 
Agiles,^ or the didactic royal chaplain, Fulcher of Chartres. 
No less well was he fitted for his task by his nature and 
character. A thorough soldier, he has all the military virtues 
— ^loyalty, steadfast resolution, personal bravery, scorn 
of cowardice, and admiration of skill and courage in others, 
even in his enemies the Turks, bellorum ingeniosissimi.^ 
In recalling the stress of battle his unimpassioned style can 
kindle into eloquence.® He is keenly interested in military 
operations and in the art of war, and is a first-rate authority 
for the strategy and tactics of the First Crusade.*^ With the 
Norman adaptability and spirit of adventure he combines 
Norman shrewdness and common sense. He is practical, 
observant, fair-minded, sagacious. Yet he is full of the 
simple, somewhat credulous religious faith of his time and 
surroundings, that faith which had brought Norman Italy 
into peculiarly close relations with the Papal See. If he 
does not see visions himself, he gives credence to the visions 
of others ; he accepts the genuineness of the Holy Lance 
without hesitation ; he believes in the appearance of the 
soldier-saints and their spirit-armies at the battle of Antioch, 
because ' several of our men saw these things His book is 
a diary, a chronicle of personal experience, but it is some-

thing more ; it is a record of the great deeds wrought by 
God through the Crusaders ; it has a unity of purpose and 
a certain epic dignity, quite apart from the personality of its 
author. This the author feels. If he uses the first person, 
it is always the first person plural, not the ^ editorial we 
but the sjnnbol of the body corporate. He sinks the 
individual in the cause ; he tastes the joy of a common 
interest and of organized common action. Above all, he is 
in touch with reality. ' He writes his Latin says Hagen- 
meyer,^ ‘ just as he was accustomed to think in his Italian- 
Norman idiom.* It is this honest provincialism, which the 
later polite editors condemned as rusticity, which makes his 
work precious. He describes in simple language what he sees, 
not what other people expect him to see, and therefore ‘ he 
being dead yet speaketh *.

impiilses and passions, religious^ sentiment, the fighting 
instinct, romance ind the lure of the unknown, the loya of 
adventure and the hope of gain. So many-sided a pheno- 
menon has been attributed to many causes, but probably 
the anonymous author of the Francorum touched the 
heart of the matter when he wrote of the motio valida, the 
wave of unrest which was passing through Western society 
at the time appointed by God.^ About the same date 
another anon3mious chronicler in remote England, in writing 
of the Crusade, used much the same words : * In this year 
there was a mighty stirring {mycel styrung) of the people and 
of the peoples of other lands also/ ^ There can be little 
doubt that the First Crusade was in the main a religious 
movement which owed the force of its impetus to the 
peculiar conditions of the age, and was in itself only one 
manifestation of the general quickening and awakening, 
economic, political, social, religious, and intellectual, of a 
century which had known the fret and strain, the ' mighty 
stirring ’ of revival and reform, alike in Church and in 
State. Behind the First Crusade lay many new interests and 
activities : the growth of towns and commerce, the expansion 
of the Norman race, the development of monasticism and of 
asceticism, of missions and of organized pilgrimage ; the 
investiture struggle, also, with the controversial literature to 
which it gave birth ; and, it must always be remembered, 
the constant menace of the Turkish advance in Asia. 
In 1071 the Turks occupied Jerusalem, and the fatal 
battle of Manzikert, following on the Seljuk conquest 
of Armenia, broke down the feeble defences of the Byzan- 
tine Empire. By 1078 Jerusalem was in the hands of 
the Seljuks, while in X084 Antioch, one of the patriarchates 
of the Greek Church, was lost to Christianity. Constanti- 
nople was seriously threatened by the Seljuk Sultan of

in 1092, and internal quarrels weakened the power of his 
successors.^ But the danger was still acute. Fulcher of 
Chartres, who was present at the Council of Clermont, 
mentions the occupation of the Christian provinces of 
Rum {Romania) by the Turks as one of the reasons for the 
Pope's crossing the Alps into France in 1095. Urban II 
seems, too, to have laid special stress in his Crusading speech 
on the importance of helping the Eastern Christians to 
check the tide of Turkish conquest, which had reached the 
Bosphorus.^ Piety and Policy ^ went hand in hand in this 
high enterprise. 

It is often said that the Crusades were but part of the 
ceaseless struggle between East and West, taking a religious 
form in an age of world-religions ^ and a military form in an 
age of militarism and of fighting faiths. There had been 
peaceful pilgrimages to the Holy Land and religious wars 
against infidel Moors in Spain and Arabs in Sicily before the 
First Crusade united the pilgrimage motive with Christian 
militancy. Later romance not only set Charlemagne and 
his paladins to fight the Mohammedans of Spain, but sent 
them on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem ''without shields or 
lances or sharp swords.” ® The Crusaders trod the ‘ road of

The majority of the Western chroniclers of the eleventh 
century, the actual eyewitnesses of the First Crusade, saw in 
it the fulfilment of prophecy, the work of God, acting through 
the Church and the Pope, the Head and Father of the 
Church. Later writers magnified the personal responsibility 
for the initiative of the Holy War. The Chanson des chetifs 
and the Chanson d'Antioche, the Historia belli sacH, Albert of 
Aix, and William of Tyre, with the modern historians who 
relied mainly on these authorities, made Peter the Hermit 
the forerunner of Urban II, and the author and instigator 
of the Crusade. In the narratives of the eyewitnesses of the 
movement he falls into his proper place as a successful and 
eloquent preacher and recruiting agent, and a leader of the 
ilLfated ' Peasants ’ Crusade ' of 1096. After the establish- 
ment of the House of Boulogne on the throne of Jerusalem, 
Godfrey of Bouillon became a hero of romance, the pio 
Goffredo to whom, in Tasso's Gemsalemme Liherata, the 
heavenly message is sent which starts the Crusade. Ralph 
of Caen exalts Tancred. The author of the Gesta emphasizes 
the great services of Bohemund. Yet in the early 
twelfth century the English William of Malmesbury could 
assert that Urban's secret intention was by Bohemund's 
advice to excite almost the whole of Europe to undertake an 
expedition into Asia, that Urban might engage auxiliaries 
and recover Rome from the Anti-Pope, and that Bohemund 
might gain Illyria and Macedonia, which he claimed as his 

■wilii tlie French Crusades in Spain, and put its composition in the 
early twelfth century. Coulet has also shown that the Chanson du 
pihrinage was probably written in the twelfth century, at a later 
date than the Chanson de Roland. Cf. Notes, c. ii. 6“-8, p. 100.

due, because Robert Guiscard had won these lands from 
Alexius Comnenus,^ In the nineteenth century Sir Francis 
Palgrave,^ who was unjust to the Crusaders, and belittled 
the movement altogether, called ' the anticipated partition 
of the Greek Empire ’ the * final cause of the First Crusade 
and compared Bohemund to ‘ Master Byends ^ in the 
Pilgrim's Progress. To the Provencal Chronicler Ra37mond 
of Agiles, the Count of Toulouse, at least after the death 
of the Papal legate, is the central figure of the expedition, 
who might, had he so chosen, have been king of Jerusalem. 
From a twelfth-century Syrian and Armenian source,® 
even, comes a sort of medieval * Jenkins’ Ear ’ story 
which tells how Raymond of Toulouse, when on pilgrimage 
to Jerusalem, had an eye struck out in a quarrel with 
the Turks, and how he picked it up, brought it to Rome, 
showed it ever 5 rwhere and roused the fanaticism which 
led to great armies setting out for Constantinople, 
which they besieged ' for seven years Modem criticism 
turns from these flights of fancy to the simplicity of 
the early records, and sees in the First Crusade the work 
of medieval faith and French idealism directed and 
regulated by the Church. Behind the ‘ great adven- 
ture ’ stands the French Pope ; a French bishop, 
Adhemar of Le Puy, the Papal representative, is the 
accredited leader, rector et pastor,^ of the armed pilgrimage ; 
the Franks take the cross, the homes of France and Italy 
are left empty. In his opening chapters ^ the author of the 
Gesta has seized, with a sure instinct, on the essentials of the

xxii INTRODUCTION 

Holy War : the motive, the divine command ; the objective, 
the Sepulchre of Christ ; the incentive, the Pope’s inspired 
pleading, which gave form and voice to vague inarticulate 
desires ; the result, the concerted action of Western 
Christendom, responsive to an emotional appeal.^ 

2, Course of the Crusade. 

The history of the First Crusade has been written from 
many different points of view, racial, religious, political, 
economic, military, romantic.^ For this very reason the 
accounts of those who wrote from personal knowledge, 
before the tide of controversy had begun to flow, deserve 
careful study. It is convenient to adopt the usual modern 
division of the First Crusade into a prelude, the ' Crusade of 
the people or the ' Peasants’ Crusade and the main action, 
the ' Crusade of the Princes or the ' Barons’ Crusade ® 

The second chapter of the Gesia Francorum is occupied 
with the popular Crusade. Three out of the five bands 
which constituted that Crusade, those of GottschaJk, 
Emicho, and Folkmar or Fulk, had already perished or 
dispersed before the Anonymous began to write, but he 
shows special knowledge of the fortunes of Peter the Hermit 
and Walter the Penniless, after they joined forces at Con- 
stantinople.^ He describes, not without prejudice, the dis- 
orderly behaviour of Peter’s followers, the change in the 
attitude of the Emperor Alexius towards them, and their 
tragic adventures in Asia Minor. He speaks of the pride of

the Franks, which led the Germans and Italians to 
separate from them, of the eight days' waterless siege of 
Exerogorgo, the reputed treachery of the German leader 
Rainald, his sally and defeat, the destruction of the 
followers of Walter the Penniless, the attack on the camp at 
Civitot, the great joy of the Emperor at these disasters and 
the final rescue by the Greeks. In reality Alexius, whatever 
his private feelings may have been, had sent regular supplies 
to the Crusaders, and it was fear of the Greeks which 
eventually induced the Turks to fall back on Nicaea ; the 
Anon5nnous is unfair to the Emperor throughout. The 
story of Rainald's treachery, too, is only told by the 
Anonymous and his cop5fists, and Hagenmeyer doubts its 
truth. But true or false, it seems probable that it came 
from an Italian source. The vivid details of the sufiering of 
the thirst-tortured Crusaders at Exerogorgo, couched to 
some extent in Italian- Latin language, the special mention 
of the Lombardi et Longobardi who chose Rainald as their 
leader, the earlier mention of Lombardos et Longobardos 
whom Peter the Hermit found at Constantinople on his 
arrival, all suggest that this chapter of the book was 
written from information derived from the personal 
experience of the author’s compatriots. This, also, would 
account for the bitter feeling against Alexius, who was from 
the first suspicious of Bohemund and his Italian Normans. 
No sooner had the Crusaders set foot on Byzantine soil than 
the question of their relations with the Greeks became 
critical. After the ' Peasants ’ came the * Princes As the 
three great armies of Northern and Southern France and 
Southern Italy approached Constantinople, the Emperor 
Alexius can hardly be blamed for trying to deal diplo- 
matically with a very difficult situation and to negotiate 
separately with each Crusading leader. In particular he 
dreaded the ambition of Bohemund and the Normans 
of Southern Italy, of whose quality he had already had 



xxiv INTRODUCTION 

a taste in the invasion of the Balkan Peninsula and the 
battle of Durazzo or DyrracMum (io8i). Though he suc- 
ceeded in the end, after blood had flowed on both sides, 
in winning recognition as the feudal suzerain of all the 
Crusading leaders except Raymond of Toulouse and 
Tancred, he only seems to have won over Bohemund by 
substantial concessions and specious promises. The author 
of the Gesta makes the Emperor promise a grant of territory 
in the neighbourhood of Antioch, the seat of Bohemund's 
later principality.^ Anna Comnena says that Bohemund 
asked for the high office of Grand Domestic, which would 
have carried with it the military command of the Crusading 
armies.^ 

The Anon3mious now writes as an eyewitness, and his 
account of the march from Durazzo to Constantinople and 
the negotiations with Alexius has real original value. He 
ends his first section with the burning of the * fortress of 
heretics . . . with its inhabitants ' and the subsequent 
victory over the Greeks at the river Vardar on February i8, 
1097* His second section carries on the tale through the 
tangled maze of negotiations to the gathering of the 
Crusading forces in Asia Minor, the siege of Nicaea and 
the capitulation of the Turkish garrison to the Greeks on 
May 19, 1097. The Emperor smoothed over the friction 
caused by his retention of the city by means of lavish gifts 
to the Franks. An embassy was dispatched to Egypt to 
negotiate for an alliance with the Fatimites, who were 
hostile to the Seljuk Turks, and by June 29, 1097, the

Crusading army had started on its march in a south-easterly 
direction across Asia Minor, accompanied by the Byzantine 
representative Tatikios and his troops. The Crusaders 
marched in two divisions, some miles apart. Godfrey of 
Bouillon, Raymond of Toulouse, and Adhemar, Bishop of 
Le Puy, Hugh the Great, and Robert of Flanders were on 
the right, Bohemund and Tancred, with Robert of Nor- 
mundy, on the left. No care seems to have been taken to 
keep the two bodies in touch with one another, an error 
which nearly proved fatal. On the third day of the march, 
July I, the army of Kilij Arslan, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, 
attacked Bohemund's division in force. The author of the 
Gesta fought with the mounted knights, and his description 
of the battle, though vivid, is imperfect, but by supple- 
menting it from Raymond of Agiles, Fulcher of Chartres, and 
Ralph of Caen, a good idea of the general action can be 
formed.^ The light Turkish horse harassed the heavy-armed 
Frankish cavalry with showers of darts and arrows, as they 
galloped along their lines with wild battle-cries, iaculando 
ac spiculando et . . , sagittando,^ They had begun to pillage 
the tents in the rear of the Norman army and were mur- 
dering priests and women, when the other division of 
Crusaders, to whom Bohemund had sent an urgent message,® 
at last came riding to the rescue, and the day was saved. 

‘ God Almighty sent us help,' writes the Anon3mious : 

" unless the Lord had been with us in the battle none of us 
would have escaped.' 

The way was now open to Antioch. The Crusaders 
marched by the old Roman road to Iconium and Heraclea,

where Baldwin of Boulogne and Tancred left the main army, 
crossed the Taurus range into Cilicia, and occupied Tarsus. 
After a sharp quarrel with Tancred over the possession of the 
city, followed by' a reconciliation and further conquests, 
Baldwin rejoined the main body, only to leave it again in 
October 1097 for Armenia, and eventually to become the 
adopted heir of the Armenian prince Thoros and the 
founder of the Frankish County of Edessa.^ For the march 
from Heraclea through Lesser Armenia the Gesta Francomm 
is an admirable guide.^ By October 21,1098, the first stage 
of the Crusade ended with the appearance of Bohemund's 
army before the ' royal city ’ of Antioch. 

The siege of Antioch is the central event of the First 
Crusade and its importance is fully recognized by the 
Anon3mious, who devotes four out of the eight sections of 
his book to its history. A battle marks the close of each 
of these sections : El-Bara, on New Year's Eve, December 
31, 1097, when the Turks were defeated by Bohemund and 
Robert of Flanders ; the battle of the Lake of Antioch, 
on Shrove Tuesday, February 9, 1098, between the Franks 
and Ridwan of Aleppo and his allies ; the battle of March 6, 
1098, ending in the victory of Bohemund and Rajmiond 
of Toulouse over the Turks of Antioch after the expedi- 
tion to St. Simeon's Port, and finally the great victory 
over Kerboga on June 28, 1098. 

The city of Antioch, almost impregnable with its splendid 
fortifications, its walls, its ‘ 450 towers ' ® and its citadel, 
was held by Yagi Sian {Cassianus), the Turkish Emir and 
commander. Bohemund won the Iron Bridge to the east of 
the city and encamped outside the East Gate, or Gate of 
St. Paul.^ The other Crusading leaders took up positions on

the north and east, but the north-western Biidge Gate and 
the west and south of the city wereat firstleft open.^ Though 
Genoese ships brought supplies to the Port of St. Simeon in 
November, the Crusaders’ commissariat, transport, and lines 
of communication were ill organized, and by December the 
besiegers were suffering from famine. The last days of 
1097 saw the raid of Bohemund and Robert of Flanders in 
quest of food, which ended on New Year’s Eve with the 
battle of El-Bara, and the ‘ victorious and empty ' ^ return 
of the raiding party to camp. With the New Year scarcity 
and distress increased, and William the Carpenter and 
Peter the Hermit covered themselves with shame by an 
attempt at flight. At this time, too, the Byzantine 
representative, Tatikios, left the camp. The Anonymous, 
who is hostile to inimicus Tetigus, says that he professed to 
be going in search of supplies, but that he ' falsely feigned 
Raymond of Agiles makes him cede Tarsus and other 
Cilician towns to Bohemund and then withdraw on the pre- 
text of seeking help. Anna Conmena, on the other hand, 
attributes his departure to the intrigues of Bohemund, who 
was scheming to get Antioch for himself, and warned 
Tatikios of a plot to murder him as an agent of the 
treacherous Alexius. Von Sybel and Chalandon are 
inclined to accept this view of the matter, but Hagenmeyer 
believes that the famine in camp was a sufficient reason for 
the retirement of Tatikios, and that his subsequent failure 
to send the promised relief embittered the Crusaders 
against him. In weighing the evidence of the Gesia against 
Raymond of Agiles and Anna Comnena, though allowance 
must be made for the author’s loyalty to Bohemund, it must 
always be remembered that Raymond is the ardent partisan

of the Count of Toulouse, while Anna is a special pleader 
for her father Alexius, and both are more subtle politicians 
than the straightforward anonymous soldier-chronicler.^ 

The first stress of the siege was ended by the victories of 
February 9 and March 6, 1098, the establishment of com- 
munication with the ships at St. Simeon’s Port, and the 
building of the fort Machumatia to block the Turkish exit 
by the Bridge Gate. By the end of May Bohemund had 
won a promise from the Council of Crusading leaders that the 
city should be his if he could gain possession of it. In the 
early morning of June 3, it was betrayed into his hands by 
Firuz the Turkish Emir, but though Yagi Sian was slain, 
the Turks still held out in the citadel, and by June 8 the 
relieving army of Kerboga, Emir of Mosul, had come up and 
the Crusaders found themselves transformed from besiegers 
into besieged. Three trying weeks followed, a time of sick- 
ness, famine, and nervous strain, when many lost heart and 
escaped from the beleaguered city It is now that in all the 
contemporary sources the mystic element and the elements 
of myth, saga, and legend become prominent, until the 
psychic phenomena culminate in the finding of the 
Holy Lance on June 14. The author of the Gesta retails 
stories of Kerboga and his mother which are probably 
echoes of camp gossip and prisoners’ tales. Raymond of 
Agiles fills his pages with the visions of Peter Bartholomew 
and the other seers to whom the secret of the hidden Lance 
was revealed. Strong in the faith of Christ’s direct inter- 
vention in the hour of their greatest peril, the Crusaders 
met and defeated Kerboga on June 28, 1098. In this great 
fight the Anonymous played his part, while his fellow 
chronicler, Raymond of Agiles, bore the Holy Lance in the

battle, and many of the soldiers believed that they saw the 
heavenly hosts mounted on white horses with white stan- 
dards displayed, issuing from the mountains to their aid, 
led by St. George, St. Mercury, and St. Demetrius. By 
nightfall Bohemund's standard was floating over the sur- 
rendered citadel, and Kerboga’s army was in full flight.^' 

The end of the Crusade was not to come for more than 
a year, but to the long and eventful period which followed 
the final capture of Antioch the author of the Gesta only 
gives ten chapters. He seems to have become somewhat 
disillusioned and to have lost much of his ‘ first fine careless 
rapture His loyalty to Bohemund was weakened by his 
hero’s constant quarrels with Raymond of Toulouse, and 
eventually he appears to have joined the Provencal army, 
and to have reached Jerusalem as a humble foot-soldier. 

The last stage of the Crusade, from the battle of Antioch 
to the battle of Ascalon, included four months’ rest at 
Antioch (July to November, 1098), the siege of Marra and 
another month of rest (Nov. 27, 1098, to Jan. 13, 1099), 
the march to Area and the siege of the town (Jan. 13 to 
May 13, 1099), the march to Jerusalem (May 13 to June 7), 
the siege of Jerusalem (June 7 to July 16), the election of 
Godfrey as Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre, the elevation of 
Amulf to the Patriarchal chair of Jerusalem, and the 
campaign and battle of Ascalon (August 9 to August 12, 
1099). 

After the death, on August i, 1098, of the Bishop of 
Le Puy, political rivdry and disputes over the possession 
of the conquered territory bade fair to wreck the whole 
expedition before it had achieved its purpose. In the end,

XXX INTRODUCTION 

the rank and file of the Crusaders, the pauperes, took the 
matter into their own hands,*' and told Raymond of 
Toulouse that "if none of the princes would lead them, they 
would go to Jerusalem by themselves, bearing the Lance, 
with the Lord as their leader. At Marra they even began to 
pull down the walls to prevent further quarrels over the 
town. Raymond of Toulouse, taking this popular move- 
ment as a divine warning, now identified himself with the 
cause of the panperes, ordered the destruction of Marra, and 
marched barefoot out of the town, on the way to Jerusalem. 
But another long delay occurred at Area, where the princes 
again united forces, and the old jealousies and ambitions 
revived. Raymond of Toulouse, who was probably 
already planning to secure a princij)ality in the neighbour- 
hood of Tripoli, revenged himself on Bohemund by 
favouring the claims of Alexius Comnenus to Antioch. 
The Normans, in return, questioned the genuineness of the 
Holy Lance, and Peter Bartholomew, to whom the first 
vision had been vouchsafed, died before Area, after under- 
going the ordeal of fire to prove the truth of the revelation. 
Not until May 1099 was the forward march resumed, and 
even then Raymond of Toulouse only yielded with great 
reluctance to the urgency of Godfrey of Bouillon, who 
now came forward as the leader of the popular party.® 
The siege of Area was raised, terms were made with the 
Emir of Tripoli, Bohemimd went back to Antioch, and on 
June 7, 1099, the Crusaders at last reached and invested 
Jerusalem, which had been wrested from the Seljuk 
Turks by the Egyptian Fatimites in August 1098. On 
July 15, 1099, after a fierce general assault, the Holy City 
was taken, and the Christian triumph was celebrated by

a ruthless massacre of unbelievers. The author of the Gesta 
was present when the city was won. He mentions the 
elections of Godfrey and of the Patriarch, and he con- 
cludes with the battle of Ascalon, in August 1099, when 
an attempt on the part of the Egyptians to regain lost 
ground in Syria was foiled by the Franks. He probably ^ 
finished his book towards the end of 1099, before the 
deposition of x^rnulf from the Patriarchate. He ends, 
as he began, on a religious note, but the key has changed. 
The hope, the single-minded faith, and the spiritual 
exaltation of his opening chapters have grown dim 
in the harsh experience of the realities of war. The 
practical worldly element, always present in the book,^ 
is emphasized in the ease that followed the final effort. 
His ' great joy ' and thanksgiving after the victory of 
Ascalon are for the material rewards of righteousness, 
wheat and cheese, bread and oil, and ^ all good things \ Yet, 
quite at the last, as he writes the accustomed doxology, his 
vision clears, he turns from the earthly to the heavenly 
Jerusalem, and adds to his usual formula the words Dicai 
omnis spiritus Amen?-

45 vt fortissimus Christi athleta, et barbari irruerunt contra 
illos, eo quod nostri erant pauci; tamen simul iuncti 
inierunt bellum. Mortui sunt vero multi ex nostris

Consensit ille dictis et promissionibus dicens ; ' Tres turres 
custodio, eique libenter ipsas promitto, et quacunque

10 Boamundus iam securus de introitu ciuitatis, et gauisus 
serenaque mente, placido vultu venit ad omnes seniores, 
eisque iocunda verba intulit, dicens : ‘ Viri prudentissimi 
milites, videte quomodo nos omnes in nimia paupertate

NOTES 


Bongars di\T(ies his text, into four books and thirty-nine 
chapters. The editors of the Rectieil des historians des croisades 
keep the four books, but subdivide them into fifty-five chapters. 
Hagenmeyer omits the division into books, but retains the 
thii^-nine chapters, and adds chapter-headings and numbered 
sub-sections. The references in the following notes are to 
chapters and page lines. 

The subject-matter of the notes may be supplemented from 
the general books of reference : Ordericus Vitalis, Hist. Eccles.

I . Gain e suis renwii sunt : all the MSS. read Galliae {Gallie) 
siiis femoiae {remote) smvt. The form Galli e only occurs in 
Bongars and in Tndebod. The Recueil editors follow Bongars, 
but Hagenmeyer adopts the reading Galliae {Gallie), because 
it is found in ^ the MSS., in particular in B, which he regards 
as nearest to the origin^, while the awkward construction 
suggests an early origin. For the retention of Galli e despite 
the consensus of MS. readings in favour of Gallie it may be 
argued that Bongars is in agreement with the early plagiarist 
Tudebod, and that it would be as easy for copyists to turn 
Gain e into Gallie and thus avoid the clumsy repetition of 
Galli in two consecutive sentences {lamiamque Galli, . , . 
FeceriifU deniqiie Galli) as for Tudebod and Bongars to reverse 
the process. In a subsequent discussion of the date of Peter 
the Hermit’s arrival at Constantinople (note : c. ii. 9) Hagen- 
meyer rejects the reading of all the MSS., including B, and 
follows Bongars and Tudebod. It would seem more logical 
for these two passages to stand or fall together, as they rest 
on much the same authority. Hence, in the present emtion, 
the text of Bongars has been retained in both cases.

preacher of the ‘ People’s Crusade ’ of 1096, though his claims 
to be ' the first author ’ {primus auctar, Alb. of Aix, Lib. i, c. ii) 
of the great expedition must be regarded as legendary. They 
rest mainly on such comparatively late, romantic, and literary 
authorities as the Historia belli sacri, Albert of Aix, William of 
Tyre, and La Chanson d’Antioche.

throne of Jerusalem. Godfrey was the adopted heir of his 
uncle Godfrey the Hunchback. In 1076 he succeeded to the 
family lands, including Bouillon, and to the March of Antwerp. 
In 1089, after he had fought on the Imperialist side in the War 
of Investiture, the Emperor Henry IV granted him the duchy 
of Lower Lorraine. When in 1096 he started for the Holy Land, 
he pledged his castle of Bouillon to the Bishop of Li^ge and sold 
some of his hereditary estates. His legend connects with 
Lohengrin and the 'Swan Knight’. He is one of the 'Nine

Balduinus f rater eius : Baldwin I, King of Jerusalem, 

1 100-18, son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, and of his 
second wife Ida. He married the daughter of Ralph of Toeny, 
lord of Conches. She accompanied lum on the Crusade, but 
died near Marash in 1097. Baldwin then married an Armenian, 
niece of the Armenian prince Constantine. His third wife was 
Adelaide of Sicily, daughter of Robert Guiscard’s brother, the 
Great Count, Roger I (notes, c. x. 59-60, c. xi. 61). Cf. A. E.

troops from hearsay. Cf. c. iv, where he shows intimate 
knowledge of the army of Bohemund, his own leader and 
doniinus. 

6-8. viam, quam . . . Carolus Magnus . . . apiari fecit : 
the ' road of Charles the Great ’ was the trade-route and pil- 
grim’s way from Constantinople to Germany, which con- 
nected the Elbe with the Middle Danube, and branched off to 
the Black Sea and to the Adriatic. It was begun by Tiberius, 
contiiiued by Trajan, and completed by Constantine the Great! 
Charles the Great had relations with both the Patriarch of 
Jerusalem and the Caliph of Baghdad Harun ar-RashId, 
though the legend of the pilgrimage of Charlemagne and his 
twelve peers to the Holy Places seems to have come into being 
after the First Crusade. Robert the Monk makes Urban II at 
Clermont incite his hearers to action by reminding them of the 
deeds of Claries the Great and his son Louis, qui regna T urcO’~*' 
i^sifu^^erunt. He turns the andent Danube route into 
a m il it a r y road, made by Charlemagne for his army. Cf, Gaston

9. venit Constanimopolim Kalendis A ugusii : The Kalends of 
August would be August i. Until the appearance of the 
Recueil edition of the Gesia this date was unquestioned. The 
Recnsil editors, however, adopted the reading of E, III. Kal. 
A ugusii, i. e. July 30, and both von Sybel, in the second 
edition of his Gesch. des ersten Kreuesuges, and Hagenmeyer, 
in Peter der Eremite, accepted this emendation. Subsequently, 
Hagenmeyer reverted to his earlier opinion, and gave the date 
as August I in his edition of the Gesta Francorum, 1S90, and 
in his Chronologie de la Premiere Croisade {1902). Nearly ail the 
MSS. agree with E, but C has in (possibly a mistake for iij) 
kl. augusii. Bongars is supported by two MSS. of Tudebod 
(C and D), which have the reading i. KaL Augusii, and 
by Guibert of Nogent. Hagenmeyer follows ^ngars in 
preference to the MS. authorities, and suggests that the 
figure III in the MSS. is due to a misreading of the last letter 
of the pre\ious word, Consianiinopolim (note, c. ii. i, cf. ii. 36). 

10. Alamamiofum : Germans in general. Alemanni is 
frequently used for inhabitants of south-west Germany or for 
Swabians in particular, 

lo-ii. Lombardos et Longobardos : Northern and Southern 
Italians. It is an indication of the Italian nationality of the 
Anonymous that he has the special knowledge which enables 
him to make this distinction. 

12. imperator : Alexius I, Comnenus, 1081-1118. 

13. Brachium : the Bosphorus or Hellespont, the ' Arm of 
St. Georjge^ St. George of Cappadocia was martyred at 
Nicomedia on April 23, a.d. 303, His body was removed to 
Lydda in Palestine, but the scene of Ms martydom remained 
under his special protection and many churches and religious 
houses were dedicated to him in tMs district, among them a 
monastery at the entrance to the Straits. Ducange, Gloss., 
Brachium ; Enc. Bril., nth ed., George. 

22. Nicomedia : the modem Ismid. Stephen of Blois, in 
a letter to his wife Adela, describes it as ttrbem desolcUam a Tur- 
ds, Epp. Steph. Cam., i ; Rec, des Hist, des Crois,,Hist. occ.,m, 

25. Rahialdus {Reinaldusl : he led the Germans and Italians 
after their separation from the Franks at Nicomedia, and 
betrayed them to the Turks. He was probably a German, but 
he may be identical with Rainaldus de Castro Breis (Bray on the 
Seine ?) who is mentioned by Albert of Aix. 

26. Ronianiam : Rum, i. e. Rome, the Asiatic portion of the 
East Roman Empire. The Anonymous uses the term for Asia 
3iIinor, to the boundaries of Armenia and Syria (cf- c, xxi). 

27. Nicenam : Nicea, called in c, vii caput totius Ronianiae, 



NOTES 


ro2 

one of the chief towns of Rum or Romania, was occupied by 
the Seljuk Turks in 1078. Raymond of Agiles calls it urbs 
munitissima, tarn naiura qitam ingenio. Stephen of Blois, in 
his first letter to his wife, says that it was surrounded by walls 
and by more than three hundred lofty towers. 

28. Exerogorgo. The position of this fort or castle has not 
been satisfactorily determined. Michaud, Le Prevost, 
following Poujoulat, and the Rectieil editors, identify it -with 
EsM-Kaleh (old castle), but Hagenmeyer has shown the 
topographical difficulties in the way of accepting this identifica- 
tion. Anna Comnena and Albert of Aix say that the Crusaders 
had to take the castle by force of arms (Hagenmeyer, opera cit, 
Chron. de la Prem. Croisade, pp. 39, 40). 

36. qui est UL Kal. Octohris : Hagenmeyer omits these words, 
as a later interpolation in MSS. G (Bongars) and E (ER). He 
attributes the in Kal. of Bongars to a mistaken reading of the 
MS. figure III (iij Kal.) On the other hand, the in of Bongars* 
original MS. may be the source of the III in E. In a previous 
case (c, ii. 9) Hagenmeyer argues that cop3dsts may easily have 
read im as III. Ill Kal. Octob. is the right date. Sept. 29. 

40. flebotoniarent : flehotomare, to bleed. 

42, piscinam: piscinais an Apulian word for cistern, here used 
for a drain or sewer. Piscinae enim vocahiilo passim Apuli utun- 
tiir, ad significandas cisternas (Ducange, Gloss.). The use of this 
local word is an indication of -^e nationality of the Anonymous. 
50. Noliie iimare : Matt. x. 28. 

59. signum : target. 

60. Corosanum [Cdrrozanam (c. xviii), Corrozaniim (c. xxi)]: 
Khorasan, the region south-east of the Caspian Sea which had 
formed part of the Caliphate of Harun ar-Rashid {786-809). 
It had been conquered by the Seljuk Turks and was now 
nominally- under the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad, actually under 
the Turkish sultan. The Anonymous treats it as a province of 
Persia, lying east of Antioch (c. xxi). Einhard [Vita Karoli, xvi) 
calls Haxun ar-Rashid Aaron rex Persarmn, 

61. Aleph [Aleck (E)}; Haleb, Aleppo. An emirate, ruled 
by Ridwan in 1096. 

64. Guualterii 6 s_ sine habere : ' Sensaveor *. ' Sine pecunia % 
' Witer the Penniless \ - He and his three brothers went with 
their uncle, a French knight, Walter of Poissi (Galterius de 
Pes^io)^ (cf, Ord. Vit. Lib. ix). - Le Prevost suggests the 
derivation of the .nickname from Boissi-sans-Avoir, near 
Montfort 1 * Amauii. Robert the Monk calls Walter primicerius 
ei signifer agmints Eremiiae. He was killed at Civitot. 

Cyuito, Oiuiio [Civeiot^ Civitot^ CkevetofJ: The editors of 
the Recueil identified this place with the modem Gemlik or 
Kemlik, the ancient Cius, on the Gulf of Mudania. This was 
the view of Peyr6 [HisU de la !**« Croisade,. 1809}. But Paulin 



CHAPTER ir . 103 

Paris had already shown, in his edition of Viliehardouin^s 
Cofiqmsie de Consiantinople (Soc. de rHisL de France, 1838}, 
that Civitot must be placed on the Gulf of Ni<»media. Ville- 
hardouin, an eyewitness, writes : ' Li Civetot siet ausinc sor le 
gofire de Nichonmie, de 1’ autre part devers Nique/ (Cf. Chans. 
d'A7it,, i* p. 22, note 3). Anna Comnena makes Helenopolis the 
camping-place of Peter the Hermit's host, and Hagenmeyer, m 
an exhaustive discussion of the subject in Peter der Eremite 
(pp. 180-4), summarized in Gesia Fraficorntn, n. 8, note 65, 
locates Civitot in the immediate \icinity of Helenopolis on the 
Gulf of Nicomedia. The name Chdtot comes from the Greek 
anchorage, roadstead. Hence it was given to the 
harbour which was built near Helenopolis, the modem Hersek. 

86. Persidem : cf. notes, c. xxi.

1. Sclauinia : Croatia and Dalmatia ; par Dalmatiam, 
according to Fulcher of Chartres. Cf. Raym. of Agiles: 
Sclavonia est tellus deserta et imia ei mo'iituosa, nbi nec /eras

2. comes de S. Aegidio Raimimdus : Raymond of St. GiUes 
(S. Aegidius), south of Kimes, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, 
called 2 arry€\i}s by Anna Comnena, Sanjii {Saint GiUes) by 
Ibn el-Athir. In a charter to Cluny of ic^ he styl^ hiinself 
comes Tolosanorum ei Ritte^iensium (Rouergue), dux Narhonae, 
marchio Provmciae (Mansi, xx. 938, old ed.). He was the 
second son of Pons, Count of Toulouse, and on his father's 
death he divided the inheritance with his brother Vllham, who 
became Count of Toulouse. He subsequently acquired the 
County of Toulouse, and kept it after his brother's death. He 
marri^ the daughter and heiress of Bertrand, Count or 
Marquis of Provence, but the marriage was dissolved, as within 
the forbidden degrees of kinship. His second wife was an 
Italian-Korman, of the house of Hauteville; his third wife, 
a Spaniard of the ruling house of Castile, accompanied him on 
the Crusade, He seems to have been over fifty when he took 
the cross in 1095, but an Eastern chronicler states that he 
had already made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and had lost an 
eye in a quarrel with the Mohammedans. (Cf. Introd., p. sod.) 
This story is unsubstantiated, but Ra3mond appears to have 
been one-eyed, vir monoculus (cf. Guib. of Nogent, W. of 
Malmes.). He is also said to have fought against the Moors in 
Spain. For his later history, cf. notes, cc. xviii, xxxi, xxsdii, 
xxxiiii, XXXV, xxxix. He died in the Holy Land in 1105 
{\^aiss^te et De\ic, Hist, du Languedoc, iii, nouv. 6 d, 1873—89), 

2-3. Podiensis episcopus : Adhemar de Monteil, Bishop

of Le Poy in Auvergne, the Papal legate and representative 
on the Cnisade. The Crusading leaders, in a letter to the Pope, 
call him iuum vicar lum. To the Anonymous he was the 
Crusaders’ recior et pastor (c. xxx), to Raymond of Agiles he 
seemed * another Moses alter Moyses. He died at Antioch 
on August I, 1098 (cf. Introd., pp. xxi, :xpcv, xxix). 

3-4. antiquam Romae viam : the Appian Way {Via Appia), 
from Northern Italy to Rome, Brindisi, and Bari. 

4. Boamimdits : Bohemund, or Bohemond, eldest son of 
Robert Guiscard and of his first wife Alberada {Auhree). 
Ordericus Vitalis rightly calls him Marcus Buamimdus, for 
his baptismal name was Marcus, and Bohemund, the name 
of a legendar^^ giant, was given to him by his father iocimde 
as a nickname. Bohemund was the chief leader of the Itahan- 
Norman Crusaders and is the hero of the first part of the Gesfa 
Francorum (cf. Introd., pp. xLii-xv, xx~xxi, xxiii-xxx). 

5. Richardus de Principatu : son of William, Prince of 
Salerno, who was step-brother of Robert Guiscard. He married 
Tancred’s sister. He took part in the battle of Dorylaeum 
(c- ix), sided with Tancred in his quarrel with Baldmn at 
Mamistra, settled in the Holy Land, and in 1100 was taken 
prisoner with Bohemund by Danishmend of Sivas, 

Rotheriiis comes Flandrensis’ Robert 'of Jerusalem’, 
Count of Flanders, son of Robert Friso Count of Flanders who 
died in 1093. In 1099-1100 Robert the Crusader returned to 
Europe. He is called Georgii filius, ( lifils sahit Jorge, Chans. 
d*A ni., Ch. vi) . He brought back an arm of St. George from thq 
Crusade. 

6 . Rothertus Normannus [comes de Normannia, Normanniae ] : 
eldest son of WiUiam, the Conqueror of England. To raise 
money for the Crusade he pledged his duchy of Normandy to 
his brother William Rufus (E. A. Freeman, W. Rufus, i), 

Hugo Magnus : Hugh, Count of Vermandois, brother 
of Philip I, IGng of France. Li quens Hues-li-maines, frere au 
toi Phelipon {Chans. d'Ant, Ch. ii). The by-name Magnus 
seems to be due to a misunderstanding of the French word 
maines (from minus. Mod. moins), younger, Cf. Chroniques 
universelles : Du roi Henri remesent dui fil, Phelipes ot non li 
ainsnes ; li autres ot non Hues, en sotisnon li maisnes. 

6-7. Eufardus de Puisaiio : son of Hugh I, Seigneur of Le 
Puisac or Puiset near Janvilie, between Chartres and Orleans. 
He took an active part in the Crusade, both at Antioch and at 
Jerusalem. 

7. Ackardus de Monte Merloi [A. de Mommellou (c. xxxvii), 
candidus capiie (Alb. of Aix“: Lib. II, c. xxiii)] : Achardus of 
Montmerle (Dep. Ain) pledged his patrimony to the Abbot and'' 
Bionks of Cluny in return for money and mules when he went 
onCrusade. The pledge was never redeemed. According to the 



CHAPTER III 105 

Gesta {c. xxx\^) he was Idliedon an expedition to Jaffa in June 
1099. (Cf. Hagenmeyer, Chron, de la Pfem. Crois., 1096^ avril 12.) 

7-8. Isiiardus de Musone [Usuardiis de Musione {CER)^ : 
Raymond of Agiles mentions a Provencal Crusader callM 
Isoardus comes Diensis, and Albert of Aix mentions among the 
followers of Raymond of Toulouse, Luodewicus de Mmizunz^filius 
Tirrici de M unibiliar hi (Lib. II, c. xxiii, Rec. des hisL des Crois,, 
Hist, occ.^ iv, p. 317), or Dir id de Monthiliari (^, Bongars). 
An Olivier de Moitsan occurs in the Chansoyi d* A niioche (cf. ii, p. 
34S, Table). Musone is possibly, as the editor of the Recueil 
suggests, the castle of Mousson, which has given its name to 
Pont-d-Mousson. !Mr. \V. H. Stevenson connects Isuardus 
with the southern French name Isnard (Eisenhart) . R. of Agiles 
has Hisnardus as a form of Isuardus, R. iii. 249. 

9. Brandosim . . . Barim . . . Otrentum : Brindisi, Bari, and 
Otranto were the chief ports of embarcation from southern 
Italy for the East. 

10. Wilkelmiis Marchisi filius : Tancred’s brother (cf. 
note, c. iv. 21-2). 

1 1 . Durachium : the ancient Epidamnus, the modem Durazzo. 

12. dux illiiis loci : John Comnenus of Burazzo, the nephew 
of Alexius Comnenus, &)vemor of Durazzo. 

19-20. hiirgo vrhis : burgus forensis, faubourg, suburb. 
Cosmidium on the western shore of the Golden Horn, according 
to Hagenmeyer and Krebs {Kritik Alb. v. Aachen), Pera, on 
the south-east of the Golden Horn, according to von^ Sybel, 
Kugler {Gesch. d. Kreuzz.), and Chalandon [Alex. CoTnnene). 

24. Turcopolis : the Turcopules were Greek auxiliaries of 
Turkish ori^n. Cf. Raymond of Agdes : Tutcopoli enim 
dicuntur, qui vel nuiriii apiid Turcos vel de moire Christiana 
pairs Turco procreaniur, 

25. Pincinafis IPaizinaks, PetchSnegues^: the wild tribes, 
probably of Mongolian origin, who had settled between the 
Balkans and the Danube and were constantly at war with the 
Byzantine Greeks. In 1092, after a long period of struggle, 
Alexius I had defeated them with great slaughter. Those who 
survived were formed into a special corps in the Greek army' 
(Chalandon, Alex. Comn. cc. i, iv). 

37, portam ciuitatis : the Romanus gate (Porta Sancti 
Rotnani) in the north-west wall of the city. 

CHAPTER nil. Page 6 

2. Malfi Scafardi poniis : Amalfi, on the Gulf of Salerno. 
The Anonymous shows his intimacy with the loc^ity by dis- 
tinguishing it from Slelfi, between Naples and Bari. The siege 
of the retweilious towm by the Italian-Normans began in July 
1096. Various explanations are given of the words Scafardi 
p&ntis. Scaphardiis, scapkaldus (Ducange, Gloss.) is the French

io6 notes 

echafaud, the English scaffold. It may here mean a raised 
‘ stepped ’ bridge, or the word scaphardtts may here be con- 
nected with scapha, a boat. The early plagiamts felt the 
difficulty. Tudebod writes Scaphardi Malfi scilicet Scaphardi 
pcntiis [Capliardi pontis, Codd. BE] ; Robert the Monk has 
MalpM super litus Scaphardi pelagi. Hagenmeyer suggests 
that this may mean ‘ the Sea of Sicardus from Sicardus, 
prince of Benevento and Salerno, who conquered Amalfi in the 
ninth century'. 

6. ostensionem ; a sign. 

lo. sigmtm : Hagenmeyer follows Tudebod in reading 
somim. The reading in the Recueil (ER) agrees \vith Bohgars. 

Deus le volt : the Italian Anon^nnous and the Italian 
author of the Hist, belli sacri use Italianized forms of the 
famous battle-cr^% Detts le volU Bens lo vult {Hist, b.s.), Bongars 
is here probably nearer to the original MS. than the other 
MSS. of the Gesia which have Deus vult, while the French 
Tudebod writes Dens hoc vult. 

i6. Rogerius comes ; Roger, the * Great Count ’ of Sicily, 
Robert Guiscard's brother. 

21—2. 'Tancfedus Mavchisi filius \ Tancred, son of Robert 
Guiscard’s daughter Emma. His father was apparently either 
a marquis, called Odobonus by Ordericus Vitalis, and William 
by W. of Tyre, or, if the suggestion of Paulin Paris be accepted 
(Chans. d'Ant. ii. 370-2), a Saracen emir, called Makrisi. In 
the Chanscm d'Aniiocke Tancred is described, as le fils Marquis, 
and also as le poulani (poulain, of mixed Christian and Saracen, 
or Frank and Syrian blood), and le fils d rA?nirant (Emir). 
(Cf. Recueil, iii* boo ; de Saulcy, Bibh de VAcole des diaries, iv.)

whose father was Will, of Salerno. Nephew of Richardus de 
Prindpatu. 

26. comes de Russinolo, Russignolo : Ronciglione, north- 
west of Rome ; Roscignolo, near Salerno ; Rossano in Cala- 
bria ; or Roussillon in southern France.

homage creates the close bond between lord and man, lord and 
vassal, landlord and tenant, the feudal relationship of 
' vass^sm The act of homage is usually followed by the oath 
of fealty [fidelitas). Here hominium etfiduciam are opposed to 
the less compelling oath which the Count of Toulouse took, 
which in its terms resembled the ordinary oath of fealt}^!

6 g. Agulani [.4 ngulani] : a name of uncertain application. 
Paulin Paris {Chans. d'Ani. ii. 305, Agolans) writes : * Je crois 
que c’etoit ies Afincains de Fez but gives no reasons for his 
belief. Hagenmeyer thinks that the name may be connected 
■with snake-like (anguis) clothing. A better suggestion is that 
the name is derived from the Arabic aghu'dl (more destructive, 
most destructive). Cf. Eng. ghoul, from an Arabic root. 

72. Persarum: cL Fulcher of Chartres: Turds, scilicet 
paganis Persicis* In the thirteenth century Join\ille called 
the leader of the Charismian Turks *ii emperieres de Perse*. 
{Hist, de Si. Louis, c. 102, § 528.) 

Puhlicanorum : by Puhlicani the Anonymous means the 
Paulicians, a Manichaean sect which had taken deep root in 
Armenia and had spread into other parts of Asia Mnor and into 
the Balkan Peninsula. The Paulicians had considerable 
political importance, as reli^ous persecution led them to 
revolt against Christian authority and to ally with the Patzinaks 
against the Byzantine Greeks in Europe, and with the Moham- 
medan powers against the Christians in Asia. Hence they are 
classed with ‘ Turks, Persians, Saracens *, &c. Cf. Chans.

3-4. Solimanits dux illofum : KLlij Arslan (Turk. hUif, sabre ; 
ar5la«,lion), Suleiman II, Sultan oi Iconium, son of Suleiman I, a 
kinsman of Malik Shah. Suleiman II succeeded his father in 
1086. The Sight alluded to in the text was from Dorjdaeum 
rather than from Xicaea. The dialogue with the ten thousand

NOTES 


Arabs probably echoes the gossip of the camp and the country- 
side. It is elaborated by Robert the Monk and by Guibert of 
Nogent. 

39—40. ftiii moviua . . . equorum ; Hagenmeyer and the 
Recueil [ER) read eqititum, and Hagenmeyer explains that the 
knights were not literally dead, but as their horses had died 
they ceased to be knights and became foot-soldiers. 

43. multones : rams or sheep. 

46. Yconio \Ychonio (C), Iconio {Ha), Iconium] : the modem 
Konia. One of the two chief cities of the Sultanate of Rum. 

52. EracMam, Heraclea, Eraclea : the ancient Heraclea, 
the modern Eregli. P. Paris would identify it with the ancient 
Cybistra, von Sybel with the ancient Archalla. The ancient 
Claudiopolis has also been suggested (cf. Rec. hi. 767 (Cybistra) ; 
de Saulcy, BibL de Vi.c. des CJiartes, iv. 505 (Archalla)). 

59-60. Illic diuisit se ab aliis Tancredus : here the Anony- 
mous digresses in order to describe the expedition of Tancred 
and Baldwin to Cilicia, an episode for which he is the most 
trustworthy authority, though his report is not that of an 
eye-witness. The parenthetical character of the digression, 
which ends with the words plurima casira (1. 58), is perhaps 
indicated by the marginal figure (X.) in Bongars' text. 

62. vallem de Botrenthroi [Brotrentrot {ER), Botenthrot 
(C) ] : according to Hagenmeyer, the valley in which the 
modem Bozanta, the ancient Podandus, is situated. Von 
Sybel also identifies Botrenthrot with Podandus, and points out 
that at this point the road from Adana to Constantinople 
emerges from the mountains {op, cit., p. 304). The editors of 
the Remeil, Le Prevost and others, on the contrary, identify 
Botrenthrot with GuUek Boghas, to the south of Bozanta. 

63. Tarsum [Tharsum (C)] : Tarsus, in Cilicia, on the river 
Cydnus. The birthplace of St. Paul. The town seems to have 
been inhabited by Greeks and Armenians and garrisoned by 
Turks (cf. Introd., p. xxv). 

96. Athena : the modem Adana. Albert of Aix says that a 
Burgundian named Welf , with an independent body of troops, 
had taken the town from the Turks. Tancred found the gates 
closed, but was admitted after negotiations. Ralph of Caen, with 
greater probability, says that an Armenian was in possession 
and that he invited Tancred to Adana. Archer (Archer and 
Kingsford, The Crusades) apparently accepts Albert’s story ; 
von Sybel follows Ralph of Caen (cf . von Sybel, op, cit .) . 

Manustra [Mamisfra (CER)] : Missis, Messisse, the 
ancient Mopsuestia. Albert of Aix and William of Tyre expand 
the bare statement of the Anonymous and make Tancred 
storm the town and massacre the Turkish garrison. Ralph of 
Caen says that the Turks fied by night. It was here that the 
quarrel between Tancred and j^dwin led to actual fighting, 
followed by a reconciliation.

CHAPTER XI. Page 24 

3-4. Hermeniorum . . . Urram : Armenia ilinor, Lesser 
Armenia, the Armenian colony in Cilicia, which in 1097 was 
nominally subject to the Sultan of Baghdad. It should be 
distinguished from Greater Armenia, south-west of the 
Caspian Sea and south of Georgia. The Byzantine Emperor 
Basil II had weakened the power of the independent Christian 
princes of Armenia by his conquests and annexations, and in 
the second half of the eleventh century their remaining terri- 
tory* was conquered by the Seljuk Turks. The ancient capital, 
Ani, was taken, and in 1071 the Byzantine Greeks were de- 
cisively defeated on the Armenian 'battlefield of IManzikert. 
Armenian Christians, flying before the Turks, had occupied the 
Taurus ranges, and had found new homes in Mesopotamia, in 
the country between the Euphrates and the Taurus, and in 
Cilicia. The Anonymous seems to include part of Cappadocia 
in ' the land of the Armenians as the Crusaders' route from 
Heraclea to Caesarea does not run through Lesser Armenia (cf . 
Hagemneyer Gesia Franc, c. xi. i, note 3 ; von Sybel, op. cit . ; 
Oman, Bye. Emp., cc. xix-xx ; W. B. Stevenson,' in 
iJie East, pp. 21 seq., 275 $eq.), 

5. quoddam casinim : tms castle has not been satisfactorily 
identified. Hagemney-er guesses that it was either Kilisse 
Hissar, or, more probably, Develfi Karahissar. Bandri of 
Dol say’s it was near the town of Alfia. Roger of Wendover 
(ann. 1097) say’S that Robert duke of Normandy^ took a city, 
called Azena, and gave it to Simeon, one of his knights. But 
no traces of a to\vn called Alfia or Azena have been found in the 
district {cf. note, c. xi. iS). 

7. Synieon : Hagemneyer thinks that he was probably one 
of the smaller Armenian princes, ‘ native to the region not, 
as R. of Wendover says, a follower of Robert of Normandy. 

12. Caesaream Cappadociae : the ancient Mazaca, the 
chief city of Cappadocia, the residence of the old Cappadocian 
kings, and an important eccleaastical centre. It was taken and 
plundered by the Turks in 1067 or 1068. Baudri of Dol 
speaks of it at the time of the First Crusade as ad colum 
difuta. 

1 3. quandam ciuiiatem : B. of DoL and Ord. Vit, call this city 
Plastencia. Hagenmeyer would identify it with the modem 
HadscMn, or with Saris on the road from Caesarea to Marash. 
It is probably the stronghold (firmissimitm castrum) mentioned 
by Stephen of Blois in Ms second letter to Ms wife, as the place 

^ of refuge of the Turkish prince Assan. 

18, Peirus de Alpihus \de Aliphi, de Aliph, Ahiph (Tud.), 
Alphia (Baudri), Alfia (Ord. Vit.)]: Baudri and Ordericus 
may* have evolved the town Alfia (c. xi. 5) from tMs name.

NOTES 


Le Prevost identifies this Peter with a Provencal Pierre d’ Aulphs, 
who successively served Robert Guiscard and the Greeks! 
Hagenmeyer refers to the princeps mentioned by Stephen of 
Blois (Epp. ii.), to whom the firmissimum castrum Plastencia ’) 
was entrusted, and thinks that P. de Alpibus was the Petrus 
Aiipha who is said by Anna Comnena to have fied from Antioch. 
(Cf. notes, c. xxvii) (cf. Chalandon, op. cit., p, 194, ' Tatikios 
qu'accompagnait Pierre d*Aulps *.) 

27. Coxon : the modern Gueuksun, on the river of the same 
name. The ancient Cocussus. 

29. alumni : inhabitants. 

32-3. T^irci . . « discessisseni \ this was a false rumour. 
Cf. xi. 25, audierufii Tttrcos esse in ciuitate. 

35-6. Peivum de CastelUone ; possibly Castillon in the 
Dordogne (D6p. Gironde) (Hagenmeyer). Tudebod and Hist. b. 
sac. say that he helped to defend Machumaria (c. x\dii). 
He fought well at Marra (c. xxxiii) . Albert of Aix mentions his 
good service at the siege of Nicaea, and at the later siege of 
Arsuf in 1099. 

37. Peirum de Roasa : Le Prevost suggests Roaix (Vau- 
cluse), 

Petrum Reimimdum de Pul \de Alto Pullo . . . (R. of 
Agiles)] : one of the Machtmaria defenders. A follower of 
Raymond of Toulouse, he took part in the Invention of the 
Holy Lance, He died at Antioch, after its capture by the 
Crusaders, 

43. Vallem de Rugia : Rugia (cf. c. xxxiii) is the modem 
Riha. The valley lay east of Antioch, 

45. persecuius est valde : Tudebod adds : misiique plenam 
.hastam lahris ei nasibus Turcorum Raimmido comiti. 

48. Rusam ciuitatem : Bongars omits the name Rusam, 
which is found in E and other MSS. and in Tudebod. The 
editors of the Recueil are mistaken in confusing Rusa with 
Rugia. Fulcher of Chartres and other contemporary chroniclers 
distinguish between them. This Rusa remains unidentified. 

49-50. diabolicam montanam : the eastern chains of the 
Antitaurus, between Cocussus and Marash. 

53* saumarius : a sumpter-horse or pack-horse, a sumpter 
mule. Guib. of Nogent calls dogs sagmarii, (Cf, Ducange, 
Gloss.) 

6x. Marasii [Maras Marash. The town, which Fulcher 
of Chartres says was completely destroyed in 1114, stood high, 
overlooking a fertQe plain. It was xmder an Armenian prince 
and was apparently mainly inhabited by Armenians, though 
Alt^rt of A& sdLys that the castle or citadel had been occupied 
by Turl^, who fied before the Crusaders arrived. He al^ sa3rs 
that the wife of Baldwin died at this time near Marash.

64, Boamtmdtts : Bohemund had left the main army, to 
pursue the Turks. 

65-6. taliem, in qua regalis ciiiiias Antiochia sUa esii the 
plain of Antioch, a day’s journey in width and a day and a half's 
journey in length, according to'Raymond of Agiies. The plain 
is girt about wth mountains. The city of Antioch lies on the 
south bank of the river Orontes (cf. cc. x\’ii, xxxii, Cf. 
Archer and Kingsford, Crusades, c. iv, p. 63).

Chr^'sostom (who was bom at Antioch) and St. Jerome had 
taught that St. Peter was its first bishop. Anf lochia, in qua 
primksriiis Apostolorum Petrus caihedram decoravit pontificalem 
(Baudri of Dol. 101,28. R. iv. 40 C.) 

CH.APTER XII. Page 27 

1-2. poniem Farreum IferreumJ : the Iron Bridge, so called 
from the meaning of its Arabic name [Jisr el Hadid), The 
word farreum, ferremn, max refer to the river’ Far or Fer 
{Farfar f.iwiiis), which Albert of Aix says flowed beneath it, 
or it may be connected with ferrem, iron. The bridge crossed 
the Orontes, which is vulgarly called Fer, about eight miles 
to the east of Antioch, Below it the river bends sharply to 
the west. 

2. cur sores nosfri : Albert of Aix alone states that this 
force consisted of the mounted followers of Robert of Nor- 
mandy, Roger of Barneville, and Euerard de Poisat (Puisac), 
with 2,000 foot-soldiers. 

13. ante portam ciuitatis: Bohemund had now rejoined 
the main army. He took up his position before the East Gate 
of the cit^-, also called St. Paul’s Gate, porta orienfalis, quae 
diciiurS. Pauli ('VV. of T\Te,) ; porta, quae respicit ad Pars idem 
plagam (Alb. of Aix). 

17. ires pofias ciuitaiis : the East Gate or St. Paul’s Gate 
and two of the three northern gates, the Bridge Gate, the 
Duke’s Gate, and the I>og Gate. 

1S-19. alta . . . montanea : Mens Casius, on the west and 
south of the city. The southern walls of Antioch were built 
along a ridge of the hills w^hich ‘ run down from the mountains 
of Ansarieh to vithin half a mile of the river * (Archer and 
Kingsford, op. cit., p. 65). 

20. Turd . . . i« vrhe : Yagi Sian, the Turkish emir, and 
his troops (c. xx). 

30. excomnnmicaiis ; the Turks.

48, portam vrbis : St. Paul’s Gate, before which Bohemund 
was encamped.

tents were pitched. 

CHAPTER XIII. Page 28 

3. Maregart [Mavegarz, Malreguarty, perhaps the French 
word Mauregard. The fort or castle (castrum) was built on 
a spur of Mt. Casius, to the south of Bohemund’s camp. (Cf. 
von Sybel, p. 325 ; Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. iii. 521.) 

15. stipend iuni : proAdsions. 

25. Hierusalem et Damasco et Aleph ; Jerusalem was under 
the Turkish emir Sokman ibn Ortok, who was an ally of 
Yagi Sian, It was taken by the Fatimites in 1098. Damascus 
was governed by Dekak, and Aleppo by his brother. Rid wan. 
Dekak, with the Atabeg (minister, tutor, or guardian) Tugh- 
tdgin, his stepfather (cf. Abulfeda), and with the emir of 
Emesa, Jenah ed daula, had gathered reinforcements at 
Caesarea to relieve Antioch. It -was a body , of these troops 
that attacked Bohemund and Robert of Flanders, and were 
repulsed near Elbara, sojith-east of Antioch. Both sides seem ^ 
to have claimed J:Ee victory (cf. Kami.1 ad-din), but the Turkish 
forces did iidt advance further towards Antioch at this time. 
Stephen oFiBlois counts this expedition among the ' seven 
sieges ’ of Antioch. (Cf. von Sybel, op. cit., c. viii.) 

40-1. Nos . . . reuertentes : the Anonymous took part in 
the Elbara raid.

12. senescalcum : the seneschal or dapifer (steward) was 

one of the most important of the feudal household officials. 
Here he is found acting in a military capacity as standard- 
bearer, vexillifer episcopi (R. of A^es). The seneschals 
functions usually included military, judicial, administrative, 
and domestic duties (Ducange, Gloss., Senescalctis ; A. Luchaire, 
Mamiel des Inst, 1892, Index, S 4 nichal), 

13. fiumen : the Orontes. 

17. Tancredi montaneam : Tancred had occupied a ruined 
monastery to the west of the city, not far from the George 
Gate. Here, on high ground, he afterwards built his fort or 
' castle ’ (c, xix). (Cf. von Sybel, op. cit., p. 336 ; Hagenmeyer, 
op cit.)

gold coin i-TTcpTrepoff. The Anonymous equates a purptirus 
■with 15 soiidos detutrionmi, i. e. 180 silver pennies, of which 
12 -went to a soHdits, The solidus was not a coin at this time, 
but a unit of account, like an English guinea at the present 
day. An ass-load of food might therefore be worth 120 solidos, 
or 1,440 pence. The famine prices in the city and the scarcity 
of food are vi\idly described by Raymond of Agiles and 
Fulcher of Chartres. Ra\Tnond says that corn was so dear 
that it cost 7 or S solidos £ night to feed a horse. Fulcher says 
that the famished people ate growing crops and nettles, horses, 
asses, camels, dogs, and mice. The very poor even ate the 
hides of beasts. 


CHAPTER XV. Page 31 

I. Wilhehniis . . . Carpentarius : Vicomte de Melun, related 
to Hugh of Vermandois. He had gone 4 :hro ugh Hungary with 
the Germans under Emicho, escaped when they were cut to 
pieces near Wieselburg in August 1096. was brought to 
Constantinople as a prisoner of the Greeks, and subsequently 
joined the main army of Crusaders. He was a man of gigantic 
stature, coame and rude in nature, diet is poietis sed opere 
par CHS, in the words of Guibert of Nogent, who cannot pardon 
him for his flight from Antioch, ifis by-name ‘ Carpenter * 
is explained by Guibert : Carpentarius, non quia Jaber lignarius 
essei, sed quia in bellis cedendo, more carpeniarii insisteret, 
dicehatur ; by Hagenmeyer (P. der Eremite, p. 18, note i) as ' un

CHAPTER XVI. Page 32 

I. inimicus Tetigns [Titidus (Tud.), Taiic (R. of Agiles), 
Tafikios, Taticins] : the Byzantine imperial representative, 
who was appointed to accompany and support the Crusaders 
with a force of Greek soldiers, and to take over the cities won 
by them in the name of the Eastern Emperor. He was primi- 
cerius, a highly placed palace o£6.cial and military commander. 
To the Anonymous he is an * enemy ’ because he was opposed 
to Bohemund’s policy and because he left the Crusading army 
in the time of its greatest need. For a discussion of the 
questions arising out of the conduct of Tatikios at Antioch, 
cf. Introd., p. xxvii. (Hagenmeyer, op, cit. ; von Sybel, 
op. cit. ; Chalandon, op. cit. ; Rohncht, op. cit.) 

4. cismare ; MSS. B, C, and E, with the Recueil editors, 
omit this passage altogether. Hagenmeyer {Gest. Franc, xvi, i, 
note 4) adopts the reading seminare {al. machinari) from Tude- 
bod. Cismare is derived from the Greek crxio-fia, Lat. schisma. 
a schism. There is an old English form cisnie {Oxf. Diet., 
schism). The meaning would be to di^dde, to separate, or 
perhaps here to feign false opinions, such as a schismatic 
might hold. It is worth noting that the Greek word occurs 
in the passage which treats of the Greek inimicus. It seems 
arbitrary to reject it, 

15. papilio : tent; Fr, pavilion, 

24. Cyprum : C3rprus still formed part of the Byzantine 
Empire. It was in constant communication with the port of 
St. Simeon and Antioch, and was used by the Crusading army 
as a base for supplies. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Simeon, 
had taken refuge in the island.

40. conosiabili . . . Roiberio filio Girardi [Canosiabilis, comes 
stabidi, cQP.siabk] : the constable, like the seneschal, was a great 
feudal household official (cf. Luchaire, Man. des Inst. Frang ; 
Index, ConrMahle). Robert Fitz G^rd may have been a 
kinsman of Bohemund. He acted as'^tandard-bearer in this

mirai'isiis] : the modem emir, amir (Ducange, Gloss., sub 
vac.]. The word admiral comes from it {Oxford Diet., sub voc.), 
Babylon is Cairo, the seat, since 962, of the heterodox Shiite 
Fatimite Caliphate. The name Babylon, strictly speaking, 
refers to the old fortress, at some distance from the modem 
Cairo, which is said to have been built by one of the later 
Pharaohs to receive the Babylonian mercenaries in the 
Egyptian ser\'ice (E. J. Davis, The Invasion of Egypt by 
Louis IX of France, &c., 1897). ^ Peter, v. 13, ' The 

church that is at Babylon . , . saluteth you ^ The emir 
mentioned in the text was al-Afdal, emir or vezir of the 
reigning Fatimite caliph Mustali (1094-1101). The Franks 
had sent an embassy to Egypt from Xicaea, and their am- 
bassadors had now returned', accompanied by al-Afdal, who 
hoped to conclude an alliance with the Crusaders. 

CHAPTER X\T:IL Page 36 

II. Macliitmariam [Bafumaria (R. of Agiles)]: Machu- 
maria means a Mohammedan temple or mosque (<i. Machoniet, 
c. xxi). There were two mosques on a hUl, opposite the Bridge 
Gate, on the right bank of the Ordtefees, commanding the road 
from Aleppo to the port of St. afeieon. Cf. R. of Agiles:

the Orontes. It was also called Sediimi, Siilinus, Suaidieh, and 
by Anna Comnena, Sudei (2oi;§€t). William of Tyre identifies it, 
perhaps erroneously, with the ancient Seleucia (Hagenmeyer, 
Gesia Frn^w. xviii. 2, note ii). St. Simeon and his disciples 
occupied a monastery in the neighbourhood, on Mt* Casius. 
Hence the name, * the port of St. Simeon Genoese ships were 
lying in this harbour.

68. pontis columnas ; the pillam or piers of the bridge. The 
plight of the retreating Turks, struggling back to the city, was 
desperate, as Yagi Sian had ordered the Bridge Gate to be closed. 

79. diiodecim Ammimlii : Raymond of Agiles and Albert of 
Aix practically agree with the estimate of the Turkish loss in 
the Gesia, though Raymond does not include those buried 
in the city or drowned in the river. Stephen of Blois more 
than doubles the numbers. Robert the Monk puts them still 
higher, and one manuscript of the Chanson d'AntiocJie (Chant iv) 
gives a total of 10,000, of whom 1,500 were drowned. 

86. spiculando : throwing darts or javelins.

Raymond of Agiles writes, victualium conductores ire et redire 
a poriu potuernfU ; — portum may be the original word, but the 
authority for portamds strong, and the victory of March 6 
must have given the^rusaders easier access to the Bridge 
Gate (portam vrbis, v 6 i penis esf), over the bridge which their 
new fort (Machumaria) commanded, and to the mountains on 
the left bank of the Orontes. This explanation seems to fit 
the wor<fe of c. xix: omnes semitae pane prohibitae . . . erant 
Turds. The great object of the besiegers was to blockade 
the gates of the city.

15-16. cmiiniio . . . ar genii : coniiniio means straightway, 
at once. The mark of silver was a unit of account and weight, 
not a coin. It varied in value at difierent periods and in 
difierent places, but it usually, in the Middle Ages, equalled 
either J or J a pound sterling, according to the meaning 
given to the pound. It is sometimes equated with the tveight 
of a pound. Marca diciiitr pandas argent i vniiis librae [Papias, 
eleventh century). Hagenmeyer {Gssta Frayic, xxxix. iS, 
note 86) accepts this equation. ' Eine marca argenti ist ein 
Pfund Silber,’ but cf. Ducange, Gloss., Marca : A pud nos . . . 
marca duplicata libram efficit quae dividiiur in 16 \incias. In 
England it equalled § of a pound, 13 shillings and 4 pence.

2. PiVz/s [Pirrus, Pyrnis, PyrrJms, Firuz (Ibn el-Athir : 
Kamal ad-din), Feints (\Y. of Tyre.), Daciens {Chans. d’Ant., 
probably a confusion with Yagi Sian}'\ : he has been variously 
described as a Turk, an Armenian, and a Persian, a pervert to 
ilohammedanism, a convert to Christianity^ and an Armenian 
Christian. The story of his treachery embroidered and 
elaborated by writers on both sides. It is found in a picturesque 
form in the Chanson d^Aniioche, where Daciens ii Turs, 
induenced by what he hears of ‘ the army of God ’ [Vost Dieu) 
from his son*^, who has been a prisoner in the Crusaders* camp 
and has become a Christian, dreams that God has commanded 
him to deliver Antioch. After conferring with Bohemund, 
and murdering his own too-inquisitive wife, he betrays the 
city, and is finally baptized with his son. Fulcher of Chartres, 
who calls the treachery w’hich gave Antioch to the Crusaders 
frandem et non fraudem, makes Christ appear twice to * a 
certain Turk * and bid him surrender Antioch to the Christians. 
Ralph of Caen and Kamal ad-din treat the treachery as the 
residt of a grudge against Yagi-Sian, The simple statement 
of the AnonyTnous is probably accurate enough. Bohemund 
himself, in the letter which the" Crusading leaders sent to Urban 
n after the death of the bishop of le Puy (F. of Chartres, R, iii. 
351) writes : Ego Boamimdus, conventione facia cum quodam

7-8. Tres iurres ctisiodio : the fortifications of Antioch 
muris et iurribus et antemuralihus munita (R. of Agiles) were 

* erected by Justinian, and remodelled in the tenth century 
by the engineers of John Zimisces and Basil II ’ (Oman 
op. cit, voL ii, Bk. vii. c. ii, pp. 27-28). The city was taken 
from the Saracens by Nicephorus Phocas and again captured 
by the Seljuk Turks in 10S4. -The system of fortification was 
justly celebrated, and, combined with the natural defences of 
mountain and river, renderedThe place almost impregnable. In 
c. xxxii the Anon;^mious says that the city was enclosed with 
a double wall with 450 tovrers on the ‘ greater ' wall. Sir 
Charles Oman gives a clear reconstruction of the defences in his 
Art of W ar, vol. ii, Bk. vii. c. ii, and a plan of the siege and battle 
of Antioch (vol. i, Plates vii, \dii). There was ‘ a line of curtain, 
in which towers were placed at frequent but irregular intervals 
The towers had three storeys, and were about 60 feet high. 

* No one could walk for a quarter of a mile along the enceinte 
without passing through six or seven towers'. It was thus 
quite possible for Firuz to guard three towers, though 
Ralph of Caen only mentions one. The tower by which the 
Crusaders entered the city was at the north-western comer, 
on the mountain flank, above the Gate of St. George. W. of 
Tyre calls it the tower of the * Two Sisters iurris quae vulgari 
appellatione diciiur duarum Sororum. (Cf. plans in Rey, 
Architecture Militaire des Croises en Syria, Paris, 1871 ;

18. ingeniare : here, to storm wdth military engines. 

26. Azimitarum ; from fermejUvim. Applied to those 
who used unleavened bread for the Sacrament of the Mass. 
Here it may refer to Maronites and Armenian Christians, 
but the name was often given by the Greeks to the Latin 
Catholics . 

53. Malam coronam : ^ Evil tonsure '. The coro^ta or 
^ crown ' was the clerical tonsure. 

64. ascendit Boamundus : Hagenmeyer and the Recueil 
editors here read descendii, with Tudebod, and explain it 
as ‘ dismounted ’. Bohemund ' got down ' from his horse. 
Guib. of Nogent has de equo desiluit. 

68. scalam. From the letter of the Crusading leaders to Urban 
II (F. of Chartres, R. iii. 350, G.) it appears that Bohemund 
h i m self first fastened the ladder to the wall. Ego Boamundus 
. . * sc(das ante diem parum muro applicui. It was a rope- 
ladder, made of hide, according to Alb. of Aix. When it

that the ladder .might be made fast again. One Eastern

Paganns, and makes him the hrst to mount the ladder. 
R. of A^les and R. of Caen ascribe that honour to a Frenchman, 
Fulcherius . . . f rater Budelli Carnoiensis (cf. c. iv} or Gone! 
Carnotensis, (R of Caen). 

79. ires iitrres hahemus : were these the three towers which 
had been entrusted to Firuz ? Von S^’bel cit.) treats 
the statement in the Gesia (c. xx. 7. S) that Firuz guarded three 
towers as an error on the part of the Anomnnous.

attack. He entered the city b}' the postern, not hy the ladder. 

S6. frairem . . . Pirri ; in the Chanson d\4.niioohe Firuz 
urges his brother to become a Christian, and when he refuses, 
calls on the Frankish barons, and his brother is killed b^^ 
Count Robert of Flanders. 

90. porta , . . in sinistra parte : R. of Agiles describes this 
porta as posiernla. Albert of Aix calls it posticiim. It was 
probably one of the small posterns of which there were several 
in the west wall. It would be, as Hagenmet'er points out, 
to the north of the tower of the Two Sisters, m the direction 
of the Orontes. 

97. custello : the citadel of Antioch. It stood on the middle 
spur of Mt. Casius, to the south of the city : in medio coll is 
castellmn alind, quod lingua Graeca Colax (Gr. jcdkaf) vocatur 
(R. of Agiles) ; casirum, quod in rupe celsa est s if urn (F. of

hill, which was lower than the height on which the citadel 
was built. The casinmi in which the flying Turks took refuge 
was this citadel.

1 17. hizayiteis : The bezant or byzant was a gold coin, 
which took its name from Byzantium or Constantinople, where 
it was first struck. Originally it seems to have equalled the 
Roman solidus or aureus, but later it varied in value from 
about twen^ English shillings to ten shillings or less. There 
were also silver bezants, and Ducange says that the Sultans 
of Iconium struck ‘ Saracen ' bezants. The term ivas not used 
by the Greeks themselves. (Murray, Oxford Diet. ; Ducange,

I. Curbaram : the emir of Mosul, Kerboga, Kerbogha, 
Kerbuga or Kurhugha, called Kiwam ad-daxtla, F^ar of the 
Kingdom. His name is variously given by the western 
chroniclers as Cxirbaram, Curbamn, Corbalan or Corhaan 
(Tudebod), Corbaga or Corbaras (R. of Agiles), Corbagath 
(F. of Chartres), Corbanas or Cxirbanas {Hist, belli sacri), 
Corbaraxis d'Oliferne [Chans. d'Aniioche), See. As an explana- 
tion of Oliferne, Paulin Paris suggests either Mesopotamia, 
a region to which this name is given in the chansons de geste, 
or ^eppo. Hagenmeyer tentatively connects it with Botrun 
(Ofirun in W. of Tyre). As Emir of Mosul Kerboga was one 
of the greatest vassals of the Persian Sultan. F. of Chartres 
describes him as dux et satrapa regis Parsarum ; Albert of Aix 
as secundus a rege. 

1-2. Soldani Persiae : Baxkiarok, Barldyaroq, the Persian 
Sultan who ruled at Baghdad from 1092 to 1102. He was 
a Seljuk Turk, the eldest son of Malik Shah. Soldan or Sultan' 
is an Arabic word, meaning King, sovereign, power, doroinioru 
not, as Ordericus Vitalis explains it, quasi solus dominus, quia

biliah reigned from 1094 mS. 

II. iter longae viae : Kerboga seems to have spent some 
time in besieging Edessa on his way to relieve Antioch. 

11- 12. Hierosolymitanus Ammiralius : Mo’in ed Daiila 
Sokman, son of Ortok. Wlien in 1095 his brother, the emir of 
Jerusalem, was put into fetters by Dekak, emir of Damascus, 
ed Daula Sokman intervened and took possession of Jerusalem. 
He had allied with Ridwan of Aleppo, Dekak’s brother, 
against the Franks at Harenc in February logS, and he now 
responded to Yagi Sian's appeal for help, though they had 
formerly been enemies. 

13. Rex Damasci : Dekak, emir of Damascus. He was the 
brother of Ridwan, emir of Aleppo, and the son of the Sultan 
T utusch. His stepfather and A idbeg or minister was Tughtigin, 
the Doldequinus of William of Tjre. 

16. Curios : Kurdistan takes its name from the Kurds, an 
Aryan pwple, which gave birth to Saladin. * From time 
immemorial the Kurds have led the same wild pastoral life 
in the mountain tracts between Persia and Asia Minor'. 
(Stanley Lane-Poole, Saladin (Heroes of the Nations), p. 4.) 

23. collegium : exercitum, army. 

24. Sensadohts : Shems ed daula, son of Yagi Sian. With 
his brother he was sent to the Mohammedan princes to appeal 
for help against the Franks. He went to Damascus and 
probably to Emesa and Arabia, while his brother, Mohammed 
Asfar, appealed to Kerboga and the eastern emirs. 

28. oppido : this oppidum was the citadel of Antioch. 

31. patrauere : patrare, to bring to pass, accomplish. 

36. prqficuo : prqficuum, i. e. profit, gain.

54. ammiralium : the emir Ahm ed ibn Meruan (Kamal 
ad-din). Fulcher of Chartres (R. iii. 347) calls him Maroajte, 
He had subsequently to surrender the citadel to the Crusaders.

He eventually became a Christian (Hagenmeyer, G,F. xxii. i, 
note 4 ; xxix. ii). 

59-63. adhiic . . . possum . . . priusqitam . . . stimido : The text 
of Bongars now becomes somewhat turgid and long-%vinded, 
and the other MSS. make ' cuts ^ in the interest both of 
brevity and of sense. The above passages, which are omitted 
in the Recue il edition and in all the MSS. except G {Bongars), 
are merely redundant. In later cases the text seems to be 
actually corrupt. 

78. noniina : this reading is also found in Tudebod and in 
the Historia belli sacrL All the extant MSS. and the Rectieil 
edition have ojnnia. 

79. Amazonia flumina : the Amazons, the warlike women 
whose story was familiar to all medieval readers of Orosius, 
were said to dwell on the river Thermodon, in north-eastern 
Asia ISlinor, in the province of Pontus. 

82. Scribe . . . chartas : Comte Riant regards the letter 
of Kerboga to the Caliph as a clumsy imitation of genuine 
^lohammedan letters which had fallen into the hands of the 
Crusaders, but he does not reject its substance as impossible. 
Hagenmeyer treats it as pure fiction, on a par with the conversa- 
tions between Kerboga and his mother. The construction of 
the letter is suspiciously awkward. It introduces phrases 
which the Anonyrnous has used elsewhere in other connexions, 
such as the very improbable oath per Machomet et per omnia 
Deoruni noniina (cf. cc. xxii, xxxix), or the description of the 
Christian kinsmen of the Turks, who were driven from Romania 
and Syria and ‘ the royal city Antioch (cf. c. xi). In con- 
clusion, Kerboga boasts of lus resolve to win, not only the 
Asiatic lands and Bulgaria, but, an unexpected addition, 
Apulia, the home-land of the Aiion3nnous, a touch which 
betrays the probable source of the letter. Such fictitious 
letters and speeches were quite in the taste of the time, and 
were, indeed, a recognized form of Uterary expression, in which 
boys were trained by school exercises. 

90. pair are : here meaning generare. 

94. heu ! ceriare': the passage qualiter . . . purissimum is 
only found in Bongars, Tudebod, and the Historia belli sacrL 
The text in Bongars is evidently corrupt, and Hagenmeyer is 
probably justified in following Tudebod and the Hist, belli 
sacri in reading ceriare for ceriafe, colaia for colorata, and ceu 
for seu, readings which are adopted in this edition. It may 
have been this obscurity which caused most of the cop3rists 
to omit the whole passage, but the words ceriare, colaia, ceu, 
may also have been read as ceriate, coloraia, sen, by Bongam 
, himself, or by his printer. There is other evidence that he had 
some difficulty in deciphering Ms MSS. (c. ix). In connexion 



CHAPTER XXI 


t 25 

with the word colata, Hagenmeyer calls attention to ^Malachi, 
iii. 3 : ei pzirgabit filios Levi et colahit eos quasi aiimm et quasi 
argentum \G.F. xxi. 7, note 60). 

104. Indiam : Bongars has ludaeam and the editors of 
the Recueil accept this without question. Hagenme^-er 
prefers the reading Indiam in Tudebod {Codd. A, C,D) and in 
the Hist, belli sacri. This agrees with the parallel passage in 
c. xxi, where the Anonymous also speaks of the past conquests 
of the Christians in Rum and S^nia, and of their desire to 
extend their boundaries ' beyond" the conhnes of Chorasan ’ 
and to wipe out the Turkish name * beyond the Amazonian 
rivers Upper (superior) India corresponds better than 
Upper Judaea ivith this description and with the geographical 
terminology of the Anontmous, while the change from Indiam 
to ludaeam or ludeam would be easily made by a scribe. Cf. 
Chans. d'Ant., Chant vii. x : ' li empeiieres dTnde superiour 
and the comment of P. Paris (ii, p. 149, note i) : ' L'Inde 
superioiir fut bientot apr^ ceiebre en Occident, comme 
empire du Prestre-Jean *. For the reading ludaeam, ho\vever, 
it may be urged that it is found, not only in Bongars, but in 
two MSS- {B and E) of Tudebod.

(Rom. de Godefr. de BoiiiUon), mother of Kerboga, is not

also the Sibylline Oracles, Apocalyptic writings composed by 
Jews, and later by Christians of the second and third centuries 
A. n., in imitation of the ancient Sibylline Books, to win the 
heathen to their faith. Liutprand, w’^ho visited Constantinople

the name Grentemaisnil, Grantmesnil, Grandnna ; Grandis

Grenie mesnil {Chans, d'Ani.), is derived from Grandmesnil in 
Xormandy, near Lisieux, These two brothers were the 
younger ^ns of Hugh, baron, sheriff of Leicestershire, &c., 
an Anglo-Xorman feudatory" who with his brother Robert was 
the second founder and restorer of the Norman monastery of 
St. Evroul. William of Grantmesnil married Robert Guiscard’s 
daughter Mabel ; thus he was Bohemund’s brother-in-law. 
In the Chans, d'Ani. (Ch. iii. xxii) Baldwin puts him in charge 
of Tarsus in Cilicia. He covered himself with shame by his 
flight from Antioch, with Alberic, and, according to Tud’ebod 
and other sources, with another brother, Ivo or Ives. Alberic 
and Ivo had taken part in the rebellion of Robert of Normandy 
against his father in 1077. I'*^ i^erited the family estates

mont near Liege, w’ho is said to have returned to Europe 
with Peter the Hermit and to have been one of the founders 
of the house of Augustinian canons at Neumoustier, near 
Huy, in the Li^ge diocese, where the Hermit is supposed, on 
somewhat doubliul authority, to have ended his days. Paulin 
Paris doubts this identification, and Hagenme^’er' show’s the 
inadequacy of the eridence both for the identification and for 
the whole story of the connexion of the Hermit %vith the 
Count of Clermont, though he is inclined to think that Peter 
may have ended as an inmate of Neumoustier (Hagenmeyer, 
P. ^der Eremite, 2S, 2 82, 296, 364 ; Cf. Chans, d'Ant. ii.

2. castellum : the citadel. 

3. qtiidam sacerdos : Tudebod calls him Siephantis, R. of 
Agiles ; Stephanus, cognomlne Vale^iti, Stepha^ins Valentmns. 
He is said by R. of A^es to have seen Adhemar of Le Puy in 
a vision, during the siege of Area. 

5. ecclesia S. Marias : this church, which is described by 
Fulcher of Chartres as round, /nrma rotunda, is said to have been 
built by Justinian. During the Turkish rule in Antioch, it was 
the only church which remained to the Christians.

gives these visions in great det^. 

27. dommn meam : the church of St. Peter, the largest and 
most important Christian church in Antioch stood on a MU, 
in the southern quarter. The Turks turned it into a mosque. 
Cf. R. of Agiles (R iii. 258, D) : quam mitea Sarracsfii Malm

mentioned this church in Ms address at Clermont. When the 
Franks took the city the church of St. Peter was rededicated 
to Christian worsMp,

Pefriis : R. of Agiles, the fullest authority for the Inven- 
TOh of the Holy Lance, of which he was an eye-witness, gives 
this visionary the name of Peter Bartholomew (Petrus Bartholo- 
meus). Ord. Vit. and others call him Abraham. He was a 
Proveng^, not a priest, but the seiA^ant of a wealthier pilgrim. 
R. of Agiles describes him as pauper quidam rusiictis, a peasant, 
illiterate and ignorant. He was afraid at first to reveal his 
\isions lest it should be supposed that he was inventing them 
to get food from the bishop of Le Puy and the Count of 
Toulouse. For his ordeal and death, cf. R. of Agiles (R iii. 16S 
seq.) and F. of Chartres. 

7. lanceam Saluatoris nosiri : lancea dominica, qua 
Salvatoris oiQsiri laius Longini mamhtis perforatum fuit [Ep. 
prin. ad Urban : F. of Chartres, R iii. 351). There was an early ^ 
tradition that the lance preserved in St. Peter’s Church was 
the lance of St. Mercurius, not the Holy Lance of Longinus (cf . 
Rohiicht, Gesch. des ersie^i Kreuzz., 141, note i ; Romama, ix. 
34, note I ; xix. 564, note i). [Cf. Introd., pp. xv, xxviii.]

12. Hugo U Forcenez : Bongars has Hugo Cli Foroenez, 
probably a printer’s or cop3rist’s error, but significant as 
showing"^ that his ilSS. may have been corrupt, and that his 
printed text is not infallible* Hagenmeyer and the Recueil use 
the form adopted in the text of this edition. MS. C reads 
Hugo visanus. Hagenmeyer gives the reading insanus from 
MS. A (cf. p. 145). 3 klr. \\\ H. Stevenson has pointed out to me 
that the O.Fr. participle forsenes means insane, out of one’s 
senses. Cf. mod. Fr. forcene. Tudebod gives the name as to 
Forsenet, lo Forsennei, the Hist, belli sacri as Forsonea. The 
Chans. d*Ani. and Rob. the Monk mention the incident, but 
omit Hugh’s name. He was apparently an Italian, a follower of 
Godfrey of Monte Scabioso. Thus’ it falls to the Italian 
Anonymous to preserv^e the name of a brave compatriot. This 
episode does not seem to be identical, as von Sybel thought, 
with the attack on a tower by thirty Turks, described by R. of 
\giles (R iii 258, E) . (Cf . Hagenmeyer, G. F. xxvi, i , notes 8, 9. )

2o~i. poriam comiiis S. Aegidii : the Bridge Gate or the

21. porfam duds Godefridi : the * Duke’s Gate ’ in the north 
wall, east of the Bridge Gate, and between the Bridge Gate and 
the Dog Gate. 

25-6. pro . , . ecclesiis : Bongars, and the Recueil following 
Bongars and E, read pro aliis ecclesiis, Hagenmeyer inserts 
ecclesia Sancti Petri et Sanctae Mariae between pro and aliis, 
from MSS. A (San Lorenzo del Escorial, late 12th cent.) and 
B (Bibl. Nat. Madrid, late 13th cent* to early 14th cent.). This 
emendation has been adopted in the text, as it seems necessary 
to explain the aliis ecclesiis in the passage. Tudebod {codd, 
B, E) has : iimens quod ecclesia Saudi Petri, et ecclesia Sauctae 
Mariae arderent, (Cf. Hist, belli sacri, Rob. the Monk., Guib. of 
Nogent, ad loc.) MS. C of the Gesia omits the whole passage 
from Boamundus to ecclesiis.

plete the sense, is here inserted from Tudebod, followed by 
Hagenmeyer.

(cf. cc. xii, xvii). 

49-50. Sanctae Christianitaiis : Bongars’ text here reads 
Dei et sanctae Triniiatis, The emendation Sanctae Christiania 
tatis appears to be justified. Tudebod, in the corresponding 
passage, has sanctae Christianitaiis ininiicis, and in c. x the 
Anonymous calls the Turks inimici Dei et sanctae Christianitaiis. 
Hagenmeyer adopts this reading, which is also found in the 
Hist, belli sacri, but he omits sanctae [G.F. xxxvi, 4, note 29).

William of Malmesbury to his son. King Stephen of England. 
He returned to the Holy Land in iioi and was killed fighting 
against the Saracens in 1102.- The western chroniclers who 
wrote after he had retrieved his reputation by a glorious 
death judge him less unfavourably than his immediate con- 
temporaries.

5. Alexandreia : Alexandriola (R. of Caen), Alexandria minor 
(Alb. of Aix, W. of Tyre), Iscanderuni (Abulfeda), lies north 
of Antioch near the bay of the same name. It had been fortihecl 
and is therefore cBMtdL castrum by the Anonymous. Alb. of Aix 
says that Tancred destroyed its wails and gates in his first 
Cihcian expedition. 

10 proximam monianeam : one of the heights of the 
Amanns range (Hagemneyer, G. F. xxvu. i, note 7). 

15. Philomenam : Alb. of Aix says that Stephen took ship 
from Alexandretta and landed on a Greek island. Here he 
heard that Alexius and his army had arrived at Finiminis, where 
he joined them. Philomena is Phiiomelium, now Akshehr, 
in Phrygia, between Dorylaeum and Iconium. R. of Caen puts 
the meeting at Cuthai, the modern Kiuthahia, south-west of 
Dorylaeum. For the inter\ie\v cf. Hagenmeyer, G.F, xx\ii, 
notes ; Chalandon, Alex. Comnena, p. 203 ; von Sybel, op. cit. 

21. ducis : here in MSS. A, C, H is inserted a passage (cf. 
p. 61, foot-notes) describing how one of the * rope-dancers 
William de Archis (cf. note, c. xxiii. 16), told the Emperor that 
Bohemund had sworn that if Alexius caime to Antioch he 
should lose his head. From this Hagenmeyer infers the com- 
paratively late date of this group of MSS. The passage, he 
argues, belongs to a period when the hostility between Bohe- 
mund and Alexius had become marked, from 1105 to 1108, or 
later. William de Archis is spoken of as ha\’ing been a knight, 
but as being now a monk. (Hagenmeyer, G. F. xxvii. 2, note 
13 ; EinL § 7.) 

22. Widonem fratrem Boamitndi : Wide, Guido, or Guy was 
Bohemund’s step-brother, son of Robert Guiscard and of his 
second wife Sigelgaita, In the romances he plays a more pro- 
minent part than in sober history. (Cf. Chans. d'Ant. and 
Cheval. an Cygm.) 

58. semicano : semicanus, half-grey, grizzled. 

65. cum venerint Turd : ‘ craigna'nt, et c’estla qu’apparait

was actuall}' marching against the Greek troops.

1-3. Nos . . . penienimiis : the Anonymous was apparently 
in the church of St. Peter at the time of the Invention of the 
Holy Lance, though he was not one of the thirteen diggers of 
whom he speaks. 

4-5. iredecim homines : R. of Agiles and Tudebod say that 
there were twelve men. R. of Agiles specially mentions the 
presence of the Bishop of Orange {Aurasicensis), Count 
Raymond of Toulouse and his chaplain, Pontius de Baladuno, 
and Faraldus de Tomaiz. 

12. securo eloqnio : bold, decided speech. 

16. Herluinum : dragomandus Petri (Tudebod). He knew 
two languages, Arabic and Proven9al, according to Hagenmeyer, 
and acted as interpreter for Peter the Hermit on the mission to 
Kerboga which had been decided on in the Council of the 
Princes. 

26-8. effici Christiani . . . Christianos afficiatis ? Hagen- 
meyer (G. F. xxviii. 3, note 16), takes afficere in this passage to 
mean ‘ to benefit % and regards it as intended to heighten the 
ironic efiect of the question . It seems more likely that effic i and 
afficiatis are in apposition, and that afficere is used in the sense 
of * to injure 

42. effeminaiis gentibus : the Greeks were regarded as 
effeminate by the western peoples as well as by the Turks. 
W. of Tyre (xv. 3), ^eaks of them as effeminati Graecorum 
populi (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxvdii. 4, note 23). 

CHAPTER XXIX. Page 65 

5-6. sex acies : this chapter describes the great battle with 
Rerboga of June 28, 1098. The number of the divisions, acies, 
or turniae, their order, leaders, &c., vary considerably in the 
difierent chronicles ; though there is substantial agreement, 
they differ in details. The Anonymous and his plagiarists give 
a vivid picture of the action, which should be compared with 
the corresponding passages of R. of Agiles. Of modem 
writers. Sir Charles C 5 man (/Iri of War, vol. i, Bk. v, c. iii, p. 282 
seq,, Plates vii, viii) has given a valuable account of the battle 
from the military point of view, von Sybel and Rohricht {opp, 
cU,) may also be consulted. Hagenmeyer has very full notes 
on this subject. 

11. portans . . . lanceam: Raymond of A^es actually bore the 
Holy Lance, Vidi ego haec quae loquor, he writes, et Dominicam 
lanceam ibi ferebam, Ordericus Vitahs makes Peter Bartholo- 
mew the Lance-bearer.

batiiY, R. of Agiles) for more active service. 

poriam qiiae est ante Machomayiam : the Bridge Gate. 
This passage shows that the Anonymous was a layman and a 
soldier. {Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxix. 2, note 13.) 

29. siio ammiralio [amiralio, Ha\\ the name of tto ena^ is 
not mentioned by the Anontmons, but Hagenmeyer is inclined 
to identify him with Gelis Arslan^ Gersaslan in Fulcher’s list 
of emirs (F. of Chartres, R iii. 347), with the Roseleon mentioned 
by Albert of Aix, and with the Rouge-Lion {Rouges Uafis) of the 
Chans. d'Ani (ii. jdi). Rouge-Lion corresponds to the Turkish 
name KizU-Avsldn (red Hon), which is probabty represented by 
Fulcher’s Gelis Arslan. In the Chans. d\4nt. Rouge-Lion plays 
at chess with Kerboga just before the battle. This incident, 
without the name of Kerboga’s partner, is found in R. of Agiles, 
in F. of Chartres, and in R. of Caen. (Introd. p. xxix, note i). 

33-4. montaneam : the range lying to the north of the Bridge 
Gate. 

39. Reinaldus : W. of Tyre, foUo^ring Albert of Aix, con- 
nects this Reinaddus with a certain Reinaldus of Tul (Toul), 
a follower of G. of Bouillon, who had taken part in the siege of 
Nicaea, and in Baldwin’s expedition to Tarsus. 

50-2. Sancii Georgius, Mercurius et Detneirius : for 
- St. George cf. cc. ii, xxxvi. R. of Agiles (R iii. 290) mentions 
a later appearance of St. George to the priest Desiderius. He 
is also sa.id to have appeared, with SS. Demetrius and Theodore 
at the battle of Doiyiaeum. Si. Mercurius, another soldier 
saint, was, if his legend may be believed, a Scythian, and 
the leader of the army of the Emperor Decius in the Persian 
war. He refused to worship false gods and wats tortured, but 
an angel healed him. He was eventually put to death as a 
Christian. St. Demetrius, a native of Thessalonica and pro- 
consul of Achaia, was martyred under the Emperor Maxi- 
minianus. The element of the marvellous enters also into his 
legend. The Chans. d'A nt. and Robert the Monk add to these 
three Si. Maurice, the Christian hero of the Theban legion, 

* qu’on tint por lx>n guerrier ’ {Chans, d* Ant., Chh. viii, li). 

54-5. mtseruni ignem in herbam : R. of Agiles (R iii. 260) 
mentions the firing of the dry grass, but sa3^ that it was done 
that the Franks qui gladios non formidabani, saltim ab igne

II. Hugonem Magnum: he was charged to offer the 
Emperor the lordship of Antioch if he would fulfil his engage- 
ments to the Crusaders, make war on the Turks, and take the 
field in person (von Sybel, op. cit., p. 376). With Hugh went 
Baldwin of Hainault {de Monte, cf. cc. ii, x).

but Baldwin of Hainault appears to have been either killed or 
taken prisoner in a skirmish with the Turks near Nicaea, on his 
way to Constantinople.

Raymond one of the besiegers of Nicaea and a notable leader 
in the battle with.Kerboga. Cf. Chans. d'Ant, ii. 358. R. of 
Agiles calls him miles nobilissimus et fortis and notes his

he had doubted the genuineness of the Holy Lance, and 
Ra^nnond of Aggies {R iii. 278) relates how he appeared after 
>fcath to Peter Bartholomew and told him that for this 
^ scepticism he had suffered scourging and burning in hell. 
^\lien his unifying influence was withdrav^m, the dissensions 
among the princes became painfully apparent. For his rela*

26G)] : the modem Kefr el Bara, two days’ journey to the south- 
east of Antioch, in the mountainous re^on east of the Orontes. 

12. oracula : here oracuktm stands for a temple, a place in 
which to pray. 

13. sapieniissimum viriini ; Peter of Xarbonne was chosen 
to be bishop of Antioch. Bishop Adhemar, in the narrative of 
Ra^nnond of Agiies, appeared to Peter Bartholomew and told 
him that the C 5 )unt of Toulouse must choose a bishop in his 
place. This was done at Barra (Albara). The Count took 
counsel with the princes and clergy and then called the people 
together and Peter of Narbonne was chosen. The Count 
granted him half the city of Antioch and its territory (R. of 
Agiies, R iii, 301). The bishop accompanied the Crusading 
host to Jenissdem (cf. c. xxx\iii). 

17-1S. regressi sunt . . . tnaiofes : R. of Agfles says that after 
the death of Adhemar, Boamundus in Romaniam esi regressus, et 
dux Loiharingiae versus Roais profectus esi. By All Saints Day 
1098 they were once more gathered together in Antioch, 

26. peierare : the Count was afraid of perjuring himself by 
breaking his oath to the Emperor. 

34. cathedra : here the special place in the Church in which 
stood the chair or throne of St. Peter, who was reputed to have 
been bishop of Antioch (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxi. 4, note 17). 
The bishops and magnates held their meeting in the church, a 
common medieval practice. 

37-9. Priiisquam . . . vokterit: Hagenmeyer explains this 
to mean : ' if we wait till Bohemimd is willing to come with us, 
we shall never get to Jerusalem.* Raymond of Agil^ gives an 
interesting account of the discussion in the church of St. Peter 
and of the impatience of the ‘ people * {populus) at the delay 
caused by the selfishness and ambition of the leaders. Nos

aggredmmur (R iii. 267).

Margin : Situs urbis Antiockiae. This marginal note in 
Bongars’ text is probably due to a cop3dst rather than to the 
Anonymous himself. Hagenmeyer thinks that this whole 
chapter was inserted, out of its due place, when the Anonymous 
revised his book late in the year 1099 (G.F,, Einleit, p. 20 ; 
cf. notes, c. xii). 

2-3. quaiuor montaneae : spurs of the Mt. Casius range. 
Abulfeda says that the city is built on seven hiUs. 

7. monasteria : Hagenmeyer suggests that among the 360 
* monasteries ' were counted cells and mountain hermitages. 
Other writers mention 40 or 60 monasteries. 

9—10. duob'us muris : for Justinian’s wonderful walls, with 
their towers and defences, cf. c. xx, note 7-8, p. 120, and 
references. There are good descriptions in Oman, Art of War, 
and in Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxii. 2, notes, 9, 10. As the fortifica- 
tions ' may have enclosed an area of some four square miles ' 
(Archer and IQngsford, Crusades, p. 65), and as ‘ no one could 
walk for a quarter of a mile along the enceinte without passing 
through six or seven towers * (Oman, op. cit.), there was 
practically a chain of small* castles encircling the city. 

15. Farfar : the Orontes. 

18. septuaginia quinque reges : Tudebod attempts to give 
their names. Seleucus Nicator founded the cify about 300 b.c. 
He is said to have called it after his father Antiochus. 

20—1. ocio menses et mtum diem : October 21, 1097 to June 
3, 1098. Perhaps the month is reckoned as twenty-eight days, 
or four weeks, as Hagenmeyer suggests. 

22. ires hebdomadas : Tudebod says that Kerboga besieged 
the city for twenty-six days. 

CHAPTER XXXIII. Page 75 

4. Rugia \Roia (R. of Agiles), Rubea (Tudebod)] : Riha. It 
lies between Antioch and Marra, in the mountains to the east 
of the Orontes (cf. c. xi). 

„ 10. comites : the Counts of Toulouse and Flanders (R. of 
Agiles) ; Albert of Aix adds Gk^dfrey and Eustace of Boulogne 
and Robert of Normandy. 



CHAPTER XXXIII I 37 

13. scalae : secunda die si quainor scalas plus habuis- 
semiis, capia esset civiias (R. of Agiles). 

17. ligneum casirum : Robert the Monk (Lib. VHI, c. ii) des- 
cribes this siege-tower ver\' carefully. It had three storeys: in the 
two upper ones were soldiers f ulfy equipped and armed ; in 
the lowest one were armed men who worked the wheels on which 
the tower ran. Others had to bring up a shelter, penthouse, or 
tesiiido, and to fill in the fosse or ditch, that the tower might be 
wheeled near to the wail (cf. Oman, op. cii., voL i, Bk. iii, c. \’i). 

20. Eintardiis venatoy : Venator qiiidam, nomine Eimardus, 
qui spiriiii huccinandi erat praeditus. Nam sono^ iumiiUuosae 
voces et adversarios exterrehat, et sitos ad bella inciiabat (R. the 
IMonk, Lib. Mil, c. ii). Robert the Monk should be read for 
the siege of Marra and also R. of Agiles. 

23-4. insfyuntenfum : apparently a mangon, funda, or 
sling, worked b3" torsion, raldier than a balisia, catapult, or 
* magnified crossbow *, worked b^" tension, but the various 
terms for these machines are used almost indiscriminately 
b^^ medieval writers (Oman, op. cii., vol. i, Bk. iii, c. \'i, 
voL ii, Bk. vii, c. iii). 

26, Graecos ignes : Ignis cum oleo et adipe mixius (F. of 
Chartres'). ' A semi-liquid substance, composed of sulphur, 
pitch, dissolved nitre, and petroleum boiled together and 
mixed tWth certain less important and more obscure sub- 
stances ’ (Oman, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 46-8). Known to the 
B^^zantine Greeks from the seventh centurj^ it played a great 
part in Crusading warfare (cf. Oman, op. cit. : Joinville, Hist, de 
St. Louis, c. xliii). 

29—30. siiperiori solaria : the solarium or * sun-room ' was 
generally an upper chamber in a house. Here the word is 
used for the top store\’ of the siege-tower, which was higher 
than the town wall. 

30. Wilhelmus de Monte Pislerio : cf. c. xi. Guillehmis de 
Monte Pislerio {alias Pessulano) ipse fuit cum multis aliis in 
superiori solaria (R. the Monk, Lib. VIII, c. ii). 

43-4. Gidferius de Daiurre [Golfer tus de Turrihus (R. of 
Agiles), Gidferius delaT urre (R. the Monk)] : Lord of the castle 
of Lasturs in the Limousin. His local name is given as Dasiurs, 
Lasiitrs in the Hist, belli sacri. In the army of Raymond of 
Toulouse at Antioch, he took part in the TeU-mannas expedi- 
tion (c. xxx). Legend gives him a ‘ faithful lion w'Mch he 
saved from a snake. It followed him like a dog, and when, 
on his return home, the sailors refused to take it on board 
. ship, it swam after its master and was drowned. (Hagenmejrer, 
^ xxxiii. 5, note 25 ; Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. iii. 580 ; von 
Svbel, op. cit., 3S7 ; Vaissete, Hist, du Languedoc, ii.)

279S T 



NOTES

Recueil and Hagenmeyer in inserting from B, C, E, See., the 
sentence : ilH autem, qui ascendebani, expediehant circa illos 
nmrum. It may well be original, but the passage in Bongars* 
text is complete without it. It means ' they cleared the wall 
(from enemies) about them Tudebod has : Golferius vero, 
quum fiiit supra mitrum, cepit cum illis pugnare cum lancea 
occidando. (Cf . Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxiii. 5, note 26.) 

56-7. fodaruni murum vrbis : R. of Agiles (R iii, 269, H) 
says that the Turks in the town threw at the Franks stones 
and darts, fire, logs of wood, beehives full of bees, and lime. 

78. vnuni mensem ei quatuor dies : December ii, 1098 to 
January 13, 1099. 

79. Oriensis episcopus : William, bishop of Orange. He 
was present at the Councils of Piacenza and Clermont, was 
sent by the Pope on a crusading mission to Genoa and then 
joined the Provengal army. It was he who gathered the 
people together in the siege of Marra, and exhorted them to 
pie-fy and perseverance. 

CHAPTER XXXIIII. Page 78 
17. honestare : Raymond of Toulouse ordered his knights at 
Antioch to put the palace and the tower over the Bridge Gate 
into a good state of defence. Honestare here means to equip, 
to prepare for war. 

21. Capharda : Kajarfah, Kefrtab, near Marra, on the road 
from Aleppo to Hamah, had been conquered by Yagi Sian 
and his allies in 1096. It is called castrum or oppidum by the 
chroniclers, and Raymond of Toulouse had already occupied 
and garrisoned it, in the plunder-raid which he made firom 
Marra early in January 1099. 

23. Rex . . . Caesar eae : the emir Ibn Moncad (Kamal ad- 
din, Ibn el-Athir). Caesarea on the Farfar, called Larissa ad 
Orontem in the old itineraries (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxiv. 5, 
note 22), is the Sheyzar, Scheizar, Chezar of the Arabs. * the 
rocky fortress of Sheyzar, the ruins of which still overhang 
theOrontes (Stanley Lane-Poole, Saladin, p. 28 seq.) Osama 
(Ousfima, Usama), the Arab writer, was its prince in the 
twelfth century (cf. Derenbourg, Ousdma ibn Mounhidh). 

49, Kephaliam ; the ancient Raphania, Rafinia (Kamal 
ad-din), between Apamea and Tripolis ; oppidum extra 
Libanum montem situm (F, of Chartres, R iii. 479). 

54. montaneam : the Ansariya or Ansarieh Mountains, 
north of Lebanon. 

vallem de Sem : Bongars' text has de Lem in this passage, 
Basem An c. xxxv; Hagenmeyer reads Desem in both cases, 
but fails to explain the form. The Recueil editors read de Sem 
and Besem. This probably represents the original reading. 



CHAPTER XXXIII 139 

for Tudebod {codd. B, E) bas vcdlem de Issem. Bongars' de 
Lem is an obvious scribal error. It is possible that this name 
"is connected with Hisn el-Akfdd, the famous ‘ Kurds’ Castle % 
known later as Crac des Chevaliers. This fortress lies at the 
end of the El Bukeia plain, which appears to be the valiem of 
the text, where it opens out to the sea (Stanley Lane-Poole, 
op, ciL, pp. 27, 246 ; Hagenmeyer, G.F, xxxiv. 9, note 36). 
It is more probable, as has been suggested to me, that de 
Sem and Desem represent the Syriac d’ §em== Arabic shem, 
Syria, Damascus. The casiriim, in which ' a great multitude 
of heathen ' had gathered, 'was perhaps an early castle on the 
site of Crac des Chevaliers. 

68-g. Camda ciuitats [Eniesa, Emissa (\V. of Tyre), Hims, 
Homs, La Chamelle (Joinville) ] : lies between Aleppo and 
Damascus. 

69. Rex . . . Ulius : Jenah ed-daula, an ally of Kerboga, who 
had been present at the blockade of Antioch by the Turks. 
F. of Chartres calls this emir Ghiahadoles. 

71-2. Rex . . , TripoHs : the Kadi Abu Ali Ibn Amar (cf. 
Abulfeda) Jemal-almolk Abulhassan Ali ibn Amar (Ibn 
el-Athir). R. of Agiles attributes these embassies from the 
emim to the t^ng of the casfrum ; tefYuerat enim iotam 
fegiomm illam castelli oppugnaiio, quoniam nujiquam aniea ah 
aliquihiis poinii expugnari (R iii. 275, B). The modem name 
for Tripolis is Tarabulus, It was a flourishing Mediterranean 
port, situated in a fertile plain and surround^ by the sea on 
three sides. In the wars between Fatimites atnd ^Ijuk Turks 
' it had become almost independent, 

78. Archae [Area, Arka]: cf. F. of Chartres, (R iii. 353); 
casirum Archas ad radicem moniis Lihani situm, quod condidit 
Aracaeus {ut legitur Gen. x. 17) Chanaan filius, nepos Noe, R. of 
Agiles describe it as mitnUissimum ei imxpug>mhile viribns 
humanis. It was north of Tripolis, about four leagues distant, 
according to R. of Agiles. 

91- 2. Raimundus . . , de Tenioria : de Taiirina, p. 86 ; 
R. de Torena (Tud,), who guarded the fort Machumatia ; R. 
de Taurina {Hisf, belli sacri), who went with Raymond Piletus 
on the TeHmannas expedition. He was a southern Frenchman 
from Turenne in the Limousin, and a folio'wer of the Count 
of Toulouse (cf. Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. iii. 588). 

92- 3, Tortosam ciuiiatem : Tortosa, the ancient Antaradus, 
the modem Tartus, a small but strongly fortified seaport 
some forty miles north of Tripolis. WMie the Crusaders were 
besieging Area, Tortosa was a victualling base to which 
ships from Europe could bring supplies. 

104. Maraclea : the modem Marakia, on the sea, north of 
Tortosa.

NOTES 


CHAPTER XXXV, Page 82 

2-3. Lichiani ciuiiatem : Laodicea, the modern Ladikieh. 
It had an excellent harbour and easy communications with 
Cyprus, and it lay in a fertile \vine-gro\\dng district. At the 
time of the First Crusade it was the only place left to the 
Greeks. During the siege of Area Genoese and Venetian ships 
brought supphes for the Franks to this port. 

5. Gibellum : the ancient Gabala, now* Jebelli, south of 
Laodicea, about half-way between Area and Antioch. It 
was under the Kadi Abu Mohamed Obeid Allah (Abulfeda, 
Ibn el-Athir.) . WTien the army was before Sheyzar Ra^miond 
of Toulouse had wanted to take Gibellum, but the opposition 
of the army in general, and of Tancred in particular, led him 
to abandon the scheme (von Sybel, op. cit., 392). 

14. vltYaflumen : the Nahr Arka. Area or Arka was on its 
northern bank. 

16. contra Tripolim : Raymond of Agiles (R iii. 285, B) 
attributes the change in the submissive attitude of the emir 
of Tripolis and his refusal to pay tribute, to his knowledge of 
the quarrels among the Chrisfian leaders. 

20, aqua . . . fluebat : the Nahr Kadisha flows near the old 
town of Tripolis. R. of Agiles here mentions an aqueduct 
which brought water into the town. 

29. Naues . . . nostrae : Greek, Venetian, Genoese, and 
English ships are known to have come to the help of the 
Crusaders. R. of Agiles has an interesting passage (c, xxxii)* 
on the English ships, which had decreased in number by the 
spring of 1099 from thirty to nine or ten. 

35. Anselmus de Riboafmont \dc Ribodi Monte (Hagenmeyer, 
Gesta Franc, c. xxxv, 3, note 2.4), Riberi Monte, Ripaniondi 
(R. of Agiles), Rilomundo {Hist, belli sacri)'] : Ribemont, near 
St. Quentin (D6p. Aisne). Anselm was Count of Ostrevant 
and Valenciennes, founder of the religious house of Ribemont, 
and a great benefactor of the abbey of Anchin. He had 
played his part at Nicaea and Antioch before he was killed at 
Area. The two letters which he wrote from Antioch to 
Manasses, in French Manasse (English Manasseh, Vulgate 
Manasses), Archbishop of Rheims, have been preserved {cf. 
Hagenmeyer ; Le Provost ; von Sybel ; Chans. d^Ant. ii, 
P* 359 J Hiist. des Crois., Hist. occ. iii, pref., p. Iviii ; 

Riant, Invent. 165, 178). About this time Pontius de Bala- 
duno, the friend and fellow-author whom Ra3nnond of Agiles 
bitterly deplores, was killed by a stone from a peiraria. Before 
Area also Peter Bartholomew went through the ordeal of 
fire, and died twelve days later.

uo. Ammivalius Babyloniae : the Emir el-Afdai (cf. cc. 
xxxix). He had (R iii. 277) won Jerusalem for the Fatimites 
by bribery, after Kerboga’s defeat. R. of Agiles speaks of 
an embassy from the King of Babylon to the Franks at Area, 
to which they replied, Quod nisi gratis redderet nohis Jerusalem, 
Babyloniam calumniaremur ei. 

16. Bethelon [Bethcron (Tud.) ] : the modetn Batrun. 

17. Zebari [Gibelon (Tud.), Gihelliiluni casiriim (F. of Char- 
tres), Gihilot (Alb. of Aix), Giobbeil (Abulfeda) ] : the ancient 
Byblus, the modem JebeLl (Jiblah), on the sea, south of 
Tripoiis. 

■ 19. Brayni : the Xahr Ibrahim, which falls into the sea 
to the south of Byblus. 

20-1. oia nimis a}2gusta : the pass between Byblus and 
Berytus. 

25. Baruth : Berydus, the modem Beirut. 

26. Sagiiia : Sidon, the modem Saida. ' The former 
metropolis of all the Phoenician towns, and one of the oldest 
to'vms of the world’ (Hagenmeyer). It was now under 
Egyptian dominion. 

27. Sur : T\Te. T\Te was also under the Egyptians. It 
was a very' important commercial centre, and a famous port. 

A cram [Acco (F. of Chartres) ] : the ancient Ptolemais, 
the modem Akka, Acre. The siege of Acre was the central 
episode of the Third Crusade, and its conquest by the Slamluks 
in 1291 marked the end of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 
(cf. R iii. of Agiles (R. 291) for the negotiations of the Crusaders 
with the emir of Acre). 

28. Cayphas : the modem Haifa ; a seaport, at the northern 
foot of Mt. Carmel. 

29. Caesaream : Caesarea Turris Siraionis, to be distin- 
guished from Caecarea Philippi and from Sheyzar (note, c. 
xxxiii. 23). 

31. Ramola [Ramore (c. xxxix), Rama, RamleJi ] : since the 
Saracens had evacuated the town the Franks occupied it. 

33, hanorabilis ecclesia : this church seems to have been 
outSde Ramieh, and to have belonged to Lydda, St. George’s 
birthplace, where, according to tradition, he -was buried after 
his martyrdom at Nicomedia (cf. cc. ii, xxix). Ramieh 
and Lydda were close together, and might easily be confused. 
AnothW tradition places the martyTdom of St. George at 
Lydda. 

36-7. episcopttm : Albert of Aix gives his name, Roberfus, 
and W. of Tyre says that he was a Norman from the diocese 
of Rouen.

4. eamque mirabiliter ohsedimus : for the siege of Jerusalem 
Raymond of Agiles, Albert of Aix, and William of Tyre should 
be read, in addition to the modem historians. Hagenmeyer’s 
notes on the text are very full and useful, and his Chroyiologie 
de la Premiere Croisade is indispensable for the sequence of 
events. There are good illustrations and a plan of the city 
in E. Heyck, Die Kveuzzuge und das heilige Land. 

5-6. S. Siephani . . . ecclesiam : this church lay to the north 
of the city. In 1099 it was in ruins, 

10. in monte Sion : the Proven9al army was at first on the 
west of the city. It afterwards took up a position on the hill 
of Sion on the south. The Church of St. Mary on Sion was on 
this hill (R. of Agiles, R iii. 293 ; F. of Chartres, R iii. 358). 

14. Arabes : by ‘ Arabs ' Hagenmeyer here understands 
Bedouins, 

20. minorem . . . murum : the comparatively low outer or 
second wall on the north of the city. The other three sides 
were defended by a single wall of great height and strength. 

27. nauium : the Genoese ships at Joppa. 

29-30. Syloa . . , fons : the ' pool of Siloam ’ was on the 
eastern slope of Mt. Sion. 

35. laphiae [Joppa, Jaffa"] : milhcm enim aliwm portuni 
habehamtts (F. of Chartres, R iii. 383). 

38. Wilhelmus de Sahra'. Sabran (Dep. Card). Tudebod

An the copyists of the Gesta, with R. of Caen, the Hist, belli 
sacri, and Albert of Aix, make him the first to get over the 
wall, though the honour is not undisputed (Hagenmeyer,

39. castellmn : the wooden siege-tower. 

50. Ttirri Dauid [Arjf David (F. of Chartres) ]* the later 
citadel, on the west of the city. It formed part of the defences 
of the city wall, and was so strongly fort&ed that fifteen to 
twenty men could hold it against all attacks.

65. Sepitlcrnm ; this was the real goal of the pilgrim- 
soldiers. For descriptions of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 
cf. F. of Chartres and W. of Tyre, vih. 3. The caliph Hakim 
^d destroyed the older church'in a. d. 1000, but it was rebuilt 
in the first half of the eleventh centur\’, and enlarged by the 
Crusaders (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxx\iii."7, note 38), 

CHAPTER XXXIX. Page 91 

I. Alargin : Godefridus, Rex Eleciiis, Probably due to 
a coppst (cf. c. xxxn). It occurs in Bongars' text.

stacks, the corpses were heaped up so Mgh. 

13. Scalonam ; the port of Ascalon, the Eg3^tian door of 
entry into the Holy Land. 

15. principem ciuitaiis : R. of Agiles (c, xl, R iii. 301) gives 
a simple straightforward account of Godfrey’s election. Some 
of the clergy wanted a ‘ spiritual vicar ’ to be elected first, but 
the prince" disregarded their wishes and proceeded to the 
election of a king. Ra^nnond of Toulouse was approached : 
horiabantur principes comiiem Sancii Aegidii, tit ac^iperet 
regnitm ; but he refused, saying nonien reghtm se perhorrescere 
in ilia civitaie. Godfrey was then unanimously chosen : 
elegerunt pariier diicem. Other authorities mention Robert of 
Normandy and Robert of Flanders as candidates. Contem- 
porary ciuroniclers generally call Godfrey pfinceps^ dux, or 
advocahis Sancti Sepukri, not, as is usual with later writers, 
rex, Fulcher of Chartres sa3^ that he would not he crowned 
king, and the Hist, belli sacrl gives the well-known story of his 
refusal to wear a royal crown where Christ had worn a crown 
of thorns {cf. E. Barker, The Crusades^ P- 24 ; Hagenmeyer, 
G,F. xxxix. 3, note 12). 

16-17, pairiarcham : the former patriarch, Simeon, had 
■jaken refuge in the island of Cyprus. He died in 1099. Amulf 
mad been chaplmn to Robert of Normandy, and he was also 
in favour with Odo of Bayeux, who died iii Sicily on the way
