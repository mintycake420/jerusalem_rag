ROME as the originator of the forgery action 


161 


Bridge 


Up to today, historical source research was a most wondrous secret science: not only the 
dumb amateur was denied a look into its inner workings with the warning: examinations on 
source research are no good read for the educated amateur! No, what is worse: sound 
common sense had to put up with having been thrown out by source researchers. Instead, the 
nonsense has been lifted upon the throne of method, and so today, the scientific soul of 
source critics is already so encrusted that they can proclaim without a care: the most reliable 
of all explanations is and remains — the stupidity of medieval humans as long as they were 


document and chronicle scribes. 


But how was it possible that source research could have been pushed into this dead 
end? It had to fall for this fate, unsaveably, necessary by nature; and for the simple reason 
that its action always has been, and still is, determined by the single, overpowering drive to 
save what can at all be saved in genuine historical sources. Since with a method of sound 
common sense, the authenticity of the tradition can no longer be proven, but also, since the 
authenticity of (medieval) history has to be maintained under mortal fear — at least by the 
experts — any method is welcome which seems to guarantee this authenticity anew, and if it is 


the method of nonsense. 


A sweet Wagner [Richard Wagner] anecdote reports the following: "When the party 
was enjoying themselves in the shady alleys of the park, the master [Wagner] steered the 
attention of his company, a young nature researcher, to a glass globe sitting on top of a 
column which strangely felt cold on top and warm at the bottom. The nature researcher gave 
an explanatory lecture on the deflection of rays. When he had finished, Wagner said 
laughingly: "Way off target, Doctor! I just turned the globe around, so that the side warmed 


up by the sun came bottom."! 


162 


The source researchers, too, stand before the big medieval history globe, and explain 
and interpret away, they give lectures of deep meaning on the psychological ray deflection of 
reason in medieval document scribes — and they don't even notice that this globe, too, has 
been turned, that the medieval history, too, the way it exists, does not offer untouched 


historical reality, but represents an artificial product of the forgery association. 


In this here Book 3, the focus of the investigation is on the great forgery action itself; 
the forgery headquarters, the point in time and the originators of the universal forgery action 


will be explained.

Mystery of the Franconian History of the Kings 


In this chapter, we will not look at individual medieval sources in order to prove their in- 
authenticity per se, but varying sources, seemingly independent of each other, will be placed 
next to each other in order to view them from a particular point of view. By one example of 
"multiple-entry book-keeping", we will demonstrate how the forgers' guild, in the area of the 
FRANCONIAN history of the Kings, have tried to glue irreparable cracks afterwards. Our 


samples will deliver evidence that 


the Franconian history of the Kings has to be forged in important points, and that in 


a way that Franconian Kings are made up personalities. 


I. The privileges of BENEDICT IIT. and NICOLAUS I. for CORBIE (IAFFE-WATTENBACH 
263). I join the argument of K VOIGT who has occupied himself with the peculiarities of 


those two papal diplomas in the MIOG [see endnotes], vol. XXXV, p 142 ff. 


The first diploma for CORBIE, a papyrus document of pope BENEDICT III., is dated 7th 
October 855, and that by years of reign of Emperor LOTHAR I. This dating by LOTHAR I. is 
the first peculiarity of the document, because on said day (7th October), LOTHAR I. was no 
longer reigning at all; he had abdicated, joined the monastery PRUM on 23rd September, and 
had already passed away on 29th September. "If in the papal chancery, still on 7th October, 
dating was done by his years of reign in spite of that, one has to assume that back then, 
neither his abdication nor his death were known in ROME." For the time being, this 
assumption cannot be countered. Now, from the document, we find out the following: by the 
mediation of one abbot ANSELM, the abbot ODO VON CoORBIE has visited the pope for the 


issue of privileges. It is further mentioned that two rulers had also supported the monastery 


164 


with the pope, and by those, according to VOIGT, only LOTHAR I. and LUDWIG II. can be 
referred to. If we carry on reading, we find exhortations addressed to the two rulers LOTHAR 
and LUDWIG — to respect the monastery manor CORBIE and the right to vote during their time 
of reign — this time however, the address appears in a peculiar formulation from which 
follows that the document scribe, next to LUDWIG IL., no longer had in mind, as he did 
before, Lothar I., but Lothar II. in the address! "Only two brothers match the exhortation, to 
act like "memorabiles augusti genituret avus eorum", and when it is said that Lothar's and 
Ludwig's grandfather had issued the right to vote to the monastery, we find this confirmed by 
the original document of LUDWIG THE PIOUS and LOTHAR."? If thus the pope exhorts Lothar 
II. and Ludwig II., during their reign (suis temporibus), to maintain the right to vote 
according to the example of their predecessors, such exhortation can only make sense ifin 
ROME, one was informed that Lothar I. had died, or if at least the abdication was known in 
ROME! This assumption however, stands in stark contradiction to the dating from which 
followed that in ROME, on 7th October, one knew of neither the abdication nor the death of 
Lothar I.!! Voigt regards this document as authentic, but that means as much as that we have 
met the already plenty known semi-idiots from the chanceries of the German Kings now in 
the papal chancery, too! Since we non-diplomatists, having been blessed with reason, cannot 
believe in these semi-idiots of the medieval chanceries, we must declare a document with 
such contradictions for flat out forged. For the likes of us, there is simply no traction to what 
Voigt declares to be the solution to the riddle, that in Rome, one must have simply known of 
Lothar's intention of abdicating, because the biggest mystery of the peculiar document is still 


to come. 


The most conspicuous fact consists of what is not mentioned in the document. 
"However, exceedingly alienating is the fact that the pope addresses his exhortation to not 


force an abbot on the monastery CORBIE and to respect the right to vote to LOTHAR II. and 


165 


LuDwic II. at all. Why, practically, these two rulers did not qualify for interference with the 
right to vote of the monks of CORBIE, but CARL THE BALD did, the real master of the 
WESTERN FRANCONIAN King's monastery who had lively relations with it; however, he is 
completely ignored in the document of Benedict." So, despite abbot ODO VON CORBIE, via 
mediation of abbot ANSELM, having delivered to the pope, and thus to the papal 
chancery, the necessary documents for the diploma, one did not know in Rome who was 
the actual master of the monastery! However, in order to not fail at all, one did not perhaps 
make inquiries on the state of affairs, but instead, to be on the safe side, one addressed the 
exhortations right away to two rulers — unfortunately however, the correct one was not 
amongst those two. "If in the papal chancery, one erroneously assumed that Corbie lay in the 
part of the Empire of LOTHAR L., it is understandable that in the document, CARL THE BALD, 
the real master of CORBIE, is completely ignored, and instead, Lothar II. and Ludwig II. are 
regarded as masters of the monastery." And abbot Odo accepted such a bastard of a 
document without complaint for his monastery, and guarded it like valuable treasure! 
However, the riddles attached to our document are in no way concluded. The document, 
besides the original, exists as a copy in a BERLIN cartulary (= document collection in copies), 
allegedly from the end of the 10th century. To our astonishment, we now read in this copy 
that the request for the issue of the privilege had been initiated by LOTHAR, LUDWIG and 
CARL (!), and we now see the exhortations addressed to LOTHAR, LUDWIG and CARL! And in 
order to confuse things a little more, we then find mentioned in another document, which 
pope NICOLAUS I. had issued equally to CORBIE in the year 863, and in which reference is 
made to the above document of BENEDICT, that "BENEDICT III. has issued his privilege on the 
request of CARL THE BALD, all the while BENEDICT himself does not mention CARL with one 
word in the original document, but instead mentions as requesters LOTHAR I. and Lupwic IL. 


whom in turn are ignored by NICOLAUS." (VOIGT, lL.c.) In the last case, VOIGT is looking for a 


166 


rescue from the muddle of the Kings' names by the assumption, with which anything and 
everything can be explained, that "in the composition of the NICOLAUS diploma, an error has 
occurred", or, potentially, a second document by BENEDICT was issued in which CARL really 
had been the requester for CORBIE alone. Had it really been like that, the big mysteries of the 
first document and its peculiarly modified copy would still in no way be explained by such 
assumption, and it would then still remain very peculiar that the so-called second issue of the 
BENEDICTINE privilege which supposedly mentioned CARL THE BALD, i.e. the document 
which possessed value to abbot ODO and the monastery alone, has vanished without a trace, 
was not entered in the mentioned BERLIN cartulary either, while the worthless first issue, 


which completely ignores CARL, was supposedly carefully guarded in the monastery. 


An appeal to sound common sense leaves no doubt about the fact that the document 
of BENEDICT as well as the privilege of pope NICOLAUS, and that furthermore, the entry of the 
cartulary (LOTHAR, LUDWIG and CARL) are all forged. However, they could not be practical- 
material forgeries for the benefit of CORBIE, because practical forgers, too, who worked by 
genuine model sources, and who were also able to else find their way around the historical 
disposition of CORBIE, could not have created such Babylonian confusion. If in the legal 
dispute, for which then the alleged practical forgeries sure must have been produced, the 
monks of CORBIE had presented such document collection of oddities, these writings would 
have triggered great amusement on the opposing side. That the forgers indulged in their 
imagination is quite obvious, but it is impossible that practical document forgers who had 
their eye on surreptitiously obtaining significant material advantages would have so grossly 


ignored their genuine model sources in the most important points. 


However, if our falsifications cannot represent practical forgeries, their creation must 
be traced back to a /earned action. Taking a look at the peculiarly wavering entries of the 


Kings' names, there is thus, in the choice of the rulers in both papal privileges and the 


167 


cartulary, a certain purpose and method unmistakable. One can sense it clearly how the 
forger/s are trying to let all three rulers come to their right, but cautiously avoid to chose one. 
That's why, in BENEDICT's document, they mention LOTHAR and LUDWIG, in the NICOLAUS 
diploma, they name CARL, and in the cartulary, they let all three appear together. Just no 
precise, unique determination, but keep everything in a muddy flow! So it is not by chance 
that the one document brings two, the other one, and the cartulary all three rulers, but the 
distribution of the roles has been determined in full deliberation. Such procedure 
characterises the /earned forgery action, that is, the universal action which has to work with 
fiction, since genuine model sources which could have served as a basis and orientation, did 
not exist. Because in our case, imagination played such an unusual and unintelligible part in 
the composition of the documents, we have to conclude that genuine paperwork wasn't at 
hand, and that it wasn't in reach, either — a conclusion however, which is rendered invalid by 
the fact that the learned forgers sure must have created by "genuine" prototypes, simply 
because the documents, in another respect, show quite chancery-like habits! We encounter 
insoluble contradictions which can only be removed by the one assumption: our falsifications 
are discharge of the universal forgery action. Namely, in the universal history invention 
enterprise, the seemingly irreconcilable contradiction (on the one hand slavish dependence of 
a "genuine" model source, on the other hand comprehensive disregard for any "genuine" 
paperwork and free fiction) is a common, yes, a regular side appearance of the forgery 
enterprise. Quite simply, during the entire course of the universal action, the entire stock of 
the already invented history had to be treated as though if it were real; however, the 
enormous difficulty of the task doesn't allow for a completely error-free interweaving of the 
countless threads of the phantasy action that had to be built in stages, so that in any case of 
doubt, the forgers, whether they wanted to or not, had to attempt to cover up the defective 


place in the pseudo-history. The single most utilised measure for the pasting-up of the 


168 


damage consisted of ambiguity, multiple ambiguity, of the particulars, consisted of deliberate 
complications and veiling, of Pythian formulation, yes, of the conscious use of each other 


contradicting particulars on events, persons, dates. 


The BENEDICT document per se, and in connection with the NICOLAUS privilege and 
the copy in the BERLIN cartulary, is a text book example of the wavering forgery procedure, 
operating with deliberately ambiguous and each other contradicting particulars. We will get 
to know still numerous further examples of this kind. Exceedingly frequently, in the literary 
tradition (chronicle, yearbook etc.), we encounter two starkly contradicting descriptions of 
one and the same event, that is, in the same work. An already told report once again appears 
in the same work in a different place, but the second time, with more or less strong 
variations. For this conspicuous phenomenon, historical research has always the one cheap 
explanation at hand: it is a matter of inattentiveness, accident, flighty composer or copyist, 
respectively. With the wonderful nullity of a catchword, flighty’, in competition with semi- 
idiocy, one can indeed solve such riddles effortlessly — or much rather, as we will see, one 


cannot. 


Now, which is the sore spot in the pseudo-history, the hole in the tradition, which was 
supposed to be plugged by our three documents? The wavering in the Kings' names gets us 
on the trail: there is something rotten in the FRANCONIAN history of the Kings, and also in a 
place where a confusion, a failure of the forgery action can virtually be foreseen. Namely, it 
is about the period shortly after the separation of the Empire of CHARLES THE GREAT, i.e. the 
beginning of the national histories of France, Germany and Italy! If it wasn't possible during 
this dangerous stage of the forgery action, during which, for the first time, national tendencies 
began playing a part within the forgery association, to achieve reconciliation and conformity 
in the most small and subtle amongst the French, German and Italian sections, then it had to 


come the way it then actually did, too: in this chapter of the great history novel, the threads of 


169 


the plot got into a noticeable confusion. It is now of the greatest significance whether it is 
possible to produce further evidence for this confusion in the FRANCONIAN history which 


finds its expression in the wavering entries of the rulers' names. And that is indeed possible. 


II. In the hand-writing group B of the FULDA ANNALS (yearbooks), a legation journey 
of the papal legate ARSENIUS to the CAROLINGIAN Kings is being told twice, but the second 
time with significant deviations in the factual particulars. "Once, ARSENIUS' task is said to 
have been to reconcile LUDWIG THE GERMAN with LOTHAR II. and LUDWIG OF ITALY", the 
other time, "for the latter mentioned, CARL THE BALD substitutes."* According to 
HELLMANN, there is supposedly — naturally! — a "misunderstanding of the copyist present", 
who, "either from the margins, or from special inserts where we have to imagine them 
initially, let get into the text" a correction of the first report. We want to once put ourselves 
into the shoes of this so flightily working copyist. In front of him lies a copy of the FULDA 
ANNALS from which he has to now copy the legation report. In the margins, there is a 
correction referring to LUDWIG OF ITALY. The copyist, in his flightiness, overlooks this 
correction and copies the report without noticing the note in the margins. Then, after copying 
many more pages, in turning back the pages, he accidentally discovers the correction that he 
had missed earlier, and has now an "ingenious" idea: not perhaps that he crosses out or erases 
LUDWIG, no, at the later place where he had just arrived, he once more copies the entire 
report, considering the correction! But HELLMANN himself does not place too high a value on 
the first explanation, and reckons that the correction could have stood on an inserted sheet. 
So, our inattentive copyist has already once copied ARSENIUS' report without the correction, 
and he has progressed considerably in his copying work, there, suddenly, the inserted sheet 
with the noted correction falls into his hands. Naturally, the insert has to specify to which 
place of the work the correction notice refers; for example, it must have stood there: in the 


report of ARSENIUS, LUDWIG OF ITALY is to be erased and CARL THE BALD to be put in his 


170 


place. What does the clever copyist do? Not at all the obvious, the only right thing, that which 
every reasonable human being would do in such a case, namely to insert the correction in the 
already copied report, no — he once again copies the entire legation report at the place that he 
had just reached, that is, to also top it off, to a wrong year! Now however, we can leave our 
"flighty" copyist by the side, because the core of the riddle lies in this: that a somebody, be it 
the composer or an editor of the work, had the peculiar idea, to even carry out such an 
incisive correction at all, by switching one ruler with the other. Same as in the above 
discussed BENEDICT document, this time, too, CARL has to face the misfortune to be ignored 
first. Assessed by itself, such "accident" doesn't need to make much of an impression. 
However, with view on the BENEDICT document, the name switch startles us; because we see 
the intention — and we know enough! The accident, to publish a report twice within the same 
work, what's more, noteworthily and characterisingly the second time with changes, is, as it 
happens, a forger's trick which we will still meet frequently. The historical researcher has not 
yet grown any suspicion from this phenomenon — because by general consent, it was all about 
accidents — although, or perhaps because, the variations are very frequently limited to names 
and dates. However, in such cases, the tendency of the "accidental" double report of the same 


event lies especially in the conscious changing of names and dates. 


Ill. The registry of pope JOHN VIII.° offers us further proof for the conspicuous 
insecurity in the particulars of the Franconian rulers during the time after the separation of the 
Empire. According to CASPAR (STUDIES ON JOHN VIITI.'S REGISTRY), in letter no. 87 of the 
registry, addressed to LUDWIG THE STUTTERER, CARL THE BALD's son, "apparently, from the 
margins, a second address has come in", namely beside "LUDWIG, son of CARL" still 
"LUDWIG, to the son of King LUDWIG", i.e. LUDWIG THE YOUNGER, LUDWIG THE GERMAN'S 
son. Here too, according to CASPAR's opinion, we are dealing with the registrar's accident, 


who erroneously let a note from the margins get into the text. This registrar would not only 


171 


have to have been inattentive, if he didn't notice the blunder he had produced, he would have 
to have been an idiot of the so well known to us kind if he was able, with the utmost peace of 
mind, to put yet another LUDWIG next to the one LUDWIG. And the most peculiar thing: 
neither the registrar, nor two editors later, have noticed the accident, and although much was 
being corrected, nobody has complained about the botched address! But that one left this 
lapse, which was such that the conscientious editor must have noticed it, stand untouched, is a 
sign that one did not want to see the error. It is then in this case, too, just as it is with the 
deliberate mystery of the BENEDICT document and the double report of the FULDA ANNALS: 
one was unable to decide which exact Ludwig, but one had an interest in having two irons in 


the fire, to leave a back door open. 


IV. WIDUKIND OF KORVEY now however, the famous composer of the SAXON 
history, delivers full proof that the FRANCONIAN history of the Kings and Emperors was in a 
dreadful mess. It grants us some splendid pleasure to see how the history researchers will be 
able to resign in the evaluation of this chronicler. In one breath, WIDUKIND is being praised 
beyond measure and told off in the strongest, his conscientiousness, his accuracy are being 
praised, his inattentiveness and flightyness noted with contempt. And truly, it must have been 
going on wondrously under the brain-lid of this medieval history scribe. The unpleasant fact 
cannot be denied away, that the KORVEY monk committed a long series of the most 
monstrous accidents and mistakes. Unbelievable things happened to him. Although he was 
able to easily inform himself, because he had good sources at his disposal, WIDUKIND 
confuses well-known historical personalities as though — the matter had not been history, but 
the concept of a novel. WIDUKIND regarded CARL IT. (THE BALD) of Western France and CARL 
IIT. (THE FAT) of SWABIA as one and the same person!! He confused LUDWIG, son of LUDWIG 
THE GERMAN, and LUDWIG, son of ARNULF! And not during the entire composition, not even 


on the occasion of a new edition of his work, did WIDUKIND notice such massive mistakes. 


172 


Wondrous, most wondrous — if it were true! But the most wondrous is that the historians, 
without feeling any scruples, are capable of believing in the reality of such "accidents". Yet 
how many kicks must a capacity for reason have taken that it can patiently accept the 
imputation that a medieval chronicler, who had good sources at hand in order to easily inform 
himself on the matter to be treated, could have written together such blooming nonsense, and 
on top of it, would have never noticed such blunders. Why, one would have to either assume 
that WIDUKIND belongs to the well-known category of semi-idiots, since he was capable of 
reading such monstrous things out of "genuine" sources, or one is pressed to the assumption 
that WIDUKIND, without taking a look at the sources at his disposal, has happily phantasized 
away all day. And all the while, LUDWIG, son of ARNULF, had only departed from life five 
decades ago when WIDUKIND was supposed to have written his SAXON history! Thus, the 
appeal to sound common sense ends in this result: it is psychologically impossible that a real 
chronicler of the 10th century could have been so narrow-minded and so flighty so that he 
could, in the most unbelievable manner, mix up the most famous personalities of whom he 
was only separated by a timespan of a hundred or fifty years respectively, without ever 
becoming aware of his errors. The WIDUKIND case, too, delivers a link in the chain of 
evidence that some CAROLINGIAN rulers represent phantasy beings. The universal forgery 
action failed by the task of fictionalising a completely interwoven tradition on the formation 


of the national histories of France, Germany and Italy.

2. 


EINHARD's LIFE OF CHARLES THE GREAT 


The life description of CHARLES THE GREAT belongs to the most well-known and most 
famous narrating historical sources of the Middle Ages. Up to this day, research regards this 
work as doubtlessly genuine. Now, I don't want to put up the claim that a genuine work of 
EINHARD on CHARLES never even existed at all; but I raise the question: is EINHARD's work, 
the way it exists today, the old, genuine, untouched source? I say 'no' to this question, and I 
claim: the today existing work has been systematically re-worked, i.e. forged, by the forgery 


association. The genuine work of EINHARD has been destroyed. 


On the biography of Emperor CHARLES, which goes around by the author's name of 
EINHARD, RANKE*’ has made himself heard thus: "Perhaps in no work more recently, does the 
imitation of antiquity emerge stronger than in EINHARD's life description of CHARLES THE 
GREAT. Not only in individual expressions and the phraseology, but in the organisation of the 
topic, the order of the chapters, it is an imitation of SUETON. How striking that a writer who 
has to describe one of the greatest and rarest beings of all centuries is yet grasping for words 
that have already been used once before by the one or the other Emperor. EINHARD fancies 
himself in describing the most individual attributes of the personality of his hero in idioms 
which SUETON used on AUGUSTUS or VESPASIAN, or TITUS used here and there on 
TIBERIUS... The book is full of historical errors. Not infrequently, the years of reign are given 
incorrectly..., on the separation of the Empire between the two brothers, the opposite of what 
really happened is being claimed...; the names of the popes are mixed up; CHARLES THE 
GREAT's wives as well as his children are not being listed correctly; there are so many 
mistakes noticeable that one has often doubted the authenticity of the book, although it [the 


authenticity] is beyond all doubt. (!!) 


174 


Thus, a RANKE, thus, the greatest German history writer has judged! Next to this 
judgement, let us place the statement of one of the foremost diplomatists: the abundance of 
discovered mistakes and irregularities in the diplomatical writings of the Middle Ages no 
longer entitles us to validate even nonsense as a ground of suspicion!’ — and it becomes 
evident with shocking clarity at which dangerous point historical research, complete with all 
their relative pseudo-methods, has arrived. What do researchers care for living experience! 
What do they care about sound common sense! And no matter how much they like to shake 
their heads over the most monstrous blunders and errors of medieval document and chronicle 
scribes, it is being denied them by their holy, long-handed-down "critical comparison 
method" by which they have "empirically" established that the core of the written tradition is 
indubitably genuine. Especially with regards to the life of CHARLES by EINHARD, any doubt 
over the authenticity is being suppressed with the remark: EINHARD mustn't be viewed as a 
singular phenomenon. The mistakes that can be proven to be his, have been committed in the 
same kind and severity by hundreds and hundreds of writers of the Middle Ages who have 
been acknowledged to be "genuine"! Why, is one to declare a// of those authors for not 
genuine?! So, the biography of CHARLES THE GREAT, with regards to its authenticity, stands 
beyond any doubt even for RANKE. Another modern historian, M TANGL, has spoken the 
sentence: "Jn all our research, we are slaves to the tradition."* A true word, not only with the 
special meaning the way TANGL has used it here, but with regards to historical research per 


se, and quite particularly with regards to the method! 


If one now, together with me, calls upon sound common sense as the only competent 
judge, one is completely clear, after the brief particulars of RANKE already, about the nature 
and origin of CHARLES' life description attributed to EINHARD. The little book, the way it 
exists, is an unmistakeable fruit of the universal history invention enterprise. An in-depth 


discussion may reinforce the first impression. 


175 


In order to fully understand the severity and significance of Einhard's offences that are 
to be discussed, it is necessary to remember that this author did not write fifty or a hundred 
years after CHARLES' death, neither was he supposed to have lived and died as a recluse in a 
world-removed hermitage, but that he, according to the tradition, has spent years at the court 
of Emperor CHARLES, that he has maintained familiar relations to CHARLES himself as well 
as the members of the Imperial family, and that he had to socialise with well-known and 
significant scholars. In the life description of the Emperor which, if genuine, could not have 
been created long after CHARLES' death, the alleged contemporary EINHARD now writes: "To 
say something about the birth, the childhood, yes, even the youth of CHARLES, I would 
consider silly, because nobody has put down anything in writing about it, nor is anybody still 
alive who could give us any information about this."’ This confession already breaks the 
alleged contemporary EINHARD's neck. EINHARD was supposed to have spent some effort 
trying to find out more in-depth about CHARLES' birth and youth, but to his dismay, he was 
unable to find anything in writing about it, nor did he meet anybody alive who could have 
given him any information. What? Then EINHARD was supposed to not have asked for such 
things even before the Emperor's death, when there were still people living at the court who 
could have explained? Did he have so little interest in the honoured friend and Emperor, that 
he was so completely indifferent to the latter's fates of youth? And even without asking, 
shouldn't he have heard something about the young CHARLES from the older court folks 
talking? Has not CHARLES' mother, who has supposedly lived until the year 783, has not 
anybody at all who was informed about the circumstances of the birth and youth of the great 
Emperor, told the younger, thirsty for knowledge generation of the young King's son?? Has 
really not any of the court folks and friends have the mother tell them at least the year and 
the place of the birth of her son? And if so, this enlightened one was supposed to not have 


told anybody about his knowledge? I ask once more, should a man, who, like EINHARD, has 


176 


lived at the Imperial court for years, have remained without any knowledge about the life 
circumstances of the young CHARLES? And if EINHARD has not heard and did not want to 
hear of such things before the Emperor's death, when he then finally did inquire at court, one 
was really supposed to be unable to give him any information at all, note well: none at all!, 
not even about the year and place of birth?? I declare such ignorance at the court flat out 
impossible. The author of the biography who has to confess ignorance in these points, could 
have never ever lived and worked anywhere near or at the court of CHARLES THE GREAT, else 
the sparrows on the roofs could have sung him the right tune. On the other hand, for the late 
medieval history fabulists, it was an act of wise caution to play dumb with regards to these 
precarious points, because, as so often, in this place, too, the chronological structure of the 
invented history novel came apart at the seams. The historical sources that note the Emperor's 
year of birth, offer three points in time from which to choose, namely the years 742, 743 and 


747. 


Furthermore, pseudo-EINHARD doesn't know the duration of CHARLES' time of reign; 
in chapter 15, he talks of "47 years that he reigned". This number is wrong, because 
CHARLES, according to the "real" tradition, only reigned 45 years and 4 months. But the best 
is that not a person at the court at all — the court where the most learned historians of the time 
were supposed to have lived! - knew or could have found out the correct duration of the 
Emperor's reign. Why, EINHARD reports (chapter 31) that on a gilded arch above the 
Emperor's grave in the church of MARY in AACHEN, the following inscription could be read: 
"Down here lies the body of CHARLES the great and the orthodox Emperor, who gloriously 
enlarged the Empire of the FRANCs, and who happily reigned through forty-seven years. He 
died as a seventy, in the year of the Lord 814, during the seventh indiction, on 28th January." 
So, the wrong entry of the duration of reign would have decorated even the tomb of CHARLES 


THE GREAT! If one could still be wondering about something, it is the fact that the official 


177 


grave inscription gives the date of death "quite correctly". About the duration of reign of 
KARLMANN, too, EINHARD was unable to find out the correct information, because he said 
about it: "KARLMANN, after having jointly ruled together with his brother for two years, died 
of an illness", which is incorrect, because according to the "real" tradition, KARLMANN 
reigned for 3 years and 2 months. According to EINHARD (chapter 18), CHARLES' wife 
HILDEGARD has born him 3 sons and 3 daughters. However, PAULUS DIAKONUS reports that 
HILDEGARD has given the Emperor 9 children (5 boys and 4 girls). SIMSON" seeks to justify 
EINHARD's information via the explanation that "EINHARD only counts those children of 
CHARLES from HILDEGARD who have survived BERTRADA" — of which however, Einhard 


says nothing. 


Completely plucked from thin air are EINHARD's particulars on the separation of the 
Empire. "EINHARD describes the chain of events in a way that shows that he wasn't quite in 
the know about it, and which does not deserve any credibility. He tells that after PIPPIN's 
death, the FRANCs had joined for a general Imperial congregation, and that they had installed 
both brothers as Kings, namely so that both get an equal share of the Imperial body, CHARLES 
was meant to receive that part which once their father PIPPIN had received (1.e. NEUSTRIA 
[Western part of the Empire; lat. 'Francia occidentalis'], BURGUNDY and the PROVENCE), 
KARLMANN that which, back then, their uncle KARLMANN had received (i.e. AUSTRASIA 
[AUSTRIA], ALAMANNIA and THURINGIA). FREDEGAR's 4th successor told the "true" chain of 
events. According to that, "PIPPIN himself, at the end of his life, carried out the distribution of 
the Empire between his two sons, under the council of his Greats."!! According to that 
reporter, CHARLES has now received AUSTRIA, KARLMANN however BURGUNDY, the 
PROVENCE, GOTHIA, ALSACE, and ALAMANNIA, but this time, remarkably, NEUSTRIA and 
THURINGIA happen not to be mentioned! At least with regards to ALSACE and BURGUNDY, 


documental information "confirms" that FREDEGAR's successor is in the right, because "the 


178 


few documents preserved from those years for those areas all originate with KARLMANN."” It 
is completely out of the question that EINHARD would have been unable to inform himself on 
the facts of the case. Furthermore, how is it conceivable that EINHARD got away unchallenged 
with his conscious or unconscious untruths in his biography of CHARLES?? Delightful is how 
EINHARD handles "double-entry book-keeping": in chapter 30, he reports: CHARLES died in 
the seventy-second year of his age. In the 31st chapter, he tells of the tomb arch, on which 
supposedly stood: He (CHARLES) died as a seventy. Naturally, EINHARD does not notice any 


contradiction at all!! 


EINHARD is dangerously off the rails with his description of an event which had to be 
known not only at the Imperial court, but in the entire civilised Occident: the election of 
PIPPIN to FRANCONIAN king on the authority of pope ZACHARIAS. EINHARD has King 
HILDERICH, on pope STEPHEN's orders, deposed, shaven and sent to the monastery! This 
embarrassing "accident" of EINHARD, one seeks to excuse and make explainable by the 
remark that pope STEPHEN, for his part, has confirmed the election, and because of that, we 
have the excusable error and the mix-up of the author. So, if even the contemporary of 
CHARLES THE GREAT had to commit this silly mix-up, one will not be wondering — or will 
one? — that a few centuries later at the curia in ROME the same insecurity existed as to who 
actually, whether ZACHARIAS or STEPHEN, has the last MEROWINGIAN King exit the King's 
stage. On this point, in what follows, I let Scheffer-Boihorst do the talking: "In August 1076, 
GREGORY VIL., in order to justify his move against HENRY IV., gets the bishop of METZ to 
contemplate: cur ZACHARIAS papa regem Francorum deposuerit..."'” (So, GREGORY correctly 
names ZACHARIAS.) A cardinal, DEUSDEDIT, GREGORY VII.'s court canonist, who took on 
GREGORY's statement, now "erroneously" talks about STEPHEN as the pope who had 
HILDERICH deposed. Another canonist who worked on orders of GREGORY, BONITHO, "went 


a step further still, he did not only name STEPHEN instead of ZACHARIAS, but makes the 


179 


deposed King a brother of PIPPIN. (!) One has obviously — a sign of the interest which the 
question aroused — gone crazy over details (sic!); and now, as the author of the controversial 
pamphlet DE UNITATE ECLESIAE CONSERVANDA entered the ranks against pope GREGORY, he 
named ZACHARIAS and STEPHEN.”* Truly, despite GREGORY VII. being informed on the 
"true" facts of the matter, one has gone massively crazy over "details" in ROME! The so- 
called monk of ST. GALLEN, too, proved to be very thoughtless, who allegedly around 883, 
wrote about the DEEDS OF CHARLES THE GREAT. As a successor of pope STEPHEN — he names 
LEO, so he hasn't a clue — he, the monk! — that before LEO, a pope HADRIAN had reigned for 
23 years! Erring is human, that is what historical research apologetically and soothingly says 
to that. We do the sums like this: the little book on CHARLES THE GREAT, attributed to 
EINHARD, is a fake, it shows offences so grave that a scholar, living over years at the 


FRANCONIAN court, could not possibly have been its author. 


The most striking proof however, that the original source has been destroyed, and that 
the existing source is a botched fabrication of the forgery headquarters, is being delivered by 
the so-called hand-written tradition of the ViT4 CAROLI MAGNI. I refer to the discussion on 
this statistical point in chapter 10, Book 2. As we have seen, "chance" did not only have the 


primeval script, but also the three primeval copies disappear without a trace! 


And how much the forgers, who were ordered with the re-casting of the EINHARD 
biography, racked their brains with regards to the date particulars in CHARLES' grave 
inscription, how they finally had to resort to trusty multiple-entry book-keeping, we will find 


out through HOLDER-EGGER's examinations." 


"In CHARLES THE GREAT's grave inscription, "Decessit septuagenarius anno Domini 


DCCCXIIIL, indictione VII", there is missing a.d. DCCCVIIII in one script A°. "Dom. 


180 


DCCCVIIII" is missing in script B.C", and C' has "anno indictionis septimo". The year 
numeral alone is missing from A’. Instead of Indictione VII, the scripts B' and B* have "VI". 
HOLDER-EGGER has now no other explanation for this conspicuous difference in the date 
particulars but the following assumption: "So, EINHARD's first original and B only had 
"anno..., indictione...", and in C, the year numeral surely hadn't yet been filled in, as 
conspicuous as this may be, since one cannot doubt that the Emperor's year of death was 
known to EINHARD. But the calculation by years of incarnation may not have been quite 


familiar to EINHARD, he does not give any such year in the entire V/74." 


There we have him again happily: our all-famous medieval, highly educated semi- 
idiot! Einhard, too, counts among those luxury specimen! He too, sunk into this magical 
foggy brain state as soon as he had to enter dates! Not an EINHARD, either, was able to count 
up to 50! Even such a great scholar as EINHARD stood there clueless like a little child when it 
came to date entries. He was not even able to give the year of death of his Emperor, because 
in his primeval script, he leaves a gap!! However, we know what this gap and the ambiguities 
of the different scripts mean: namely that EINHARD's work in its nowadays version is a 


fabrication of the great forgery action.

3. 


The forged medieval registries of the popes 


We now turn our eyes to quite a distinct direction: to ROME. Namely, we have a mental look- 
see in the chanceries of the medieval popes. We are primarily interested in the registry 
volumes produced in the papal chanceries. The exceedingly great significance of these 
official files and documents of the curia is explained by the circumstance that historical 
research quite rightly sees in them the backbone and the axis of the entire medieval tradition. 
The question we will raise now is this: should there have been forging going on in medieval 


ROME, too, in the cradle of the church, in the curia? 
The papal registries. In particular the registries of JOHN VIII. and GREGORY VII. 


A registry is a collection of document copies, produced in the chancery of an 
originator/issuer (pope, Emperor, bishop etc.), that is, at least principally, only the diplomas 
originating from the chancery itself, or those issued by it, qualify. The counterpiece of the 
registry is the copy book" or cartulary, a collection volume of document copies which any 
recipient set up, from the documents that he had received. The maintenance of registries, in 
which all documents, letters and decrees originating from a certain chancery are entered, has 
sprung from the desire of the originators not to lose track of the masses of issued official 
documents. An orderly administration was only possible if the decree-deciding resort was at 
all times able to inform itself on the most important points of each issued document by going 
back to the registry. If the registry maintenance in a high-standing chancery was carried out 
carelessly and incomplete, very soon, an insecure and in the long run untenable state of 
affairs had to develop, so that every originator, in their own interest, had to be concerned with 
maintaining a flawless registry. The popes have early recognised the significance and 


H] orig. 'Kopialbuch'; unable to find anything at all, including online — apologies. 


182 


advantages of an orderly registry maintenance. From the tradition, we hear that they refer to 
the registries in many cases, that they reference them for the new issue of lost documents, and 
that they had handed in letters, documents etc., compared with the relevant registry copies in 


order to check their authenticity. 


Diplomatical research holds medieval registries in general, and papal registries in 
particular, in high esteem. The conviction of the authenticity of the preserved registry 
volumes is rooted so deeply in the researchers, that any doubt is perceived as reasoning 
power losing its way. BRESSLAU comments as follows on the registry copies: "Since the 
purpose, among others, of the maintenance of registries was simply also to uncover works of 
deception, and since any chance at all that documents not originating from, or being accepted 
by, the chancery would be brought to the registry, barely ever existed, registry copies, with 
regards to the question of authenticity, will have to be completely ranked equal to the 
indubitable originals." In the year 1824, PERTZ'° writes about the registries of the popes: "The 
incomparable treasure (of the Vatican archive) are the 2016 volumes of papal registers [not 
'registries'] which are, in almost never interrupted chronological order, preserved from the 
times of INNOCENZ III. as official, always simultaneous collections of the letters, documents, 
decrees, instructions of the papal court, together with many letter and documents of the civil 
servants or other powers inserted for the explanation of the former. The question of 
authenticity goes silent (!!) with this collection, sprung from the daily desire for world 


t'’ and in their most secret archives, 


domination [sic!], stored for many hundred years with i 
whose use was, even during our centuries, permitted only in very few cases and in very 
restricted fashion." These comments are quite interesting in more than one way. With PERTZ, 
the question of authenticity goes silent not perhaps on the basis of a thorough critical 


examination of the individual registry collections, but in his mind, the doubt, facing the 


Ill lf you are wondering what ‘it' refers to, you are in the same position as | am. | was quite unable to establish 
that piece of information from the quoted passage. 


183 


thousands of volumes, is already, by the fact of the mass alone, equally stifled with an 
elementary force of nature. What's more, PERTZ also considers the authenticity of the 
registries guaranteed by the circumstance that they were kept hidden in the most secret papal 
archives, and that up to his times, outsiders were permitted a viewing only in very few cases 
and very restricted fashion, a circumstance which for us, from the angle of the universal 
forgery action, quite to the contrary, increases the mistrust in the authenticity of these 
fearfully guarded volumes. However, I have to treat the historical-diplomatical experts with 
justice: it would mean to ask them to jump over their own shadows if one were to expect that 
they, kept down by the weight of authority, the tradition and the customs, would confront the 


problem of the papal registries open-minded and without prejudice. 


Our standpoint obliges us, just like in any other genre of the tradition, so with the 
papal registries, too, to ask the principal question of authenticity, that is, the authenticity of 
the registry volumes per se, in which we utilise, as always, rational interpretation as critical 
test tool. If a late medieval universal history invention action is a fact, it goes without saying 
that the papal registries, too, are poetry, thus forged; then all the volumes which stretch to the 
threshold of modern times must be learned forgeries of the universal action. And if they are 
forgeries, then the registries must have attached the to us so well-known characteristic marks 
of CAIN of learned forgery work, then we may expect that in the registries, for example the 
conspicuous insecurity with regards to the chronological and name particulars, deliberate 


ambiguity and cover-up can be met. And, as we will see, that is the case, too. 


The registries of JOHN VII. and GREGORY VII., which we want to put through a 
comparative view for certain aspects, shall be the subjects of the critical examination. In 


doing so, we pick up from the studies on these two registries of E CASPAR"®. 


184 


The registry of JOHN VIII., which comprises of the last two thirds of his pontificate (876- 
882), according to CASPAR's view, in the only older, existing script, stemming from MONTE 
CASSINO, is supposedly not an original, but a copy. On the other hand, as PERTZ has shown 
first, and whom CASPAR also followed, we have the original registry of GREGORY VII. before 
us. It is quite striking now that only "measly leftovers" of the considerable stock of the older 
papal registries up to the year 1198 are preserved. "We do not possess immediate news on 
when these original registries have gone lost... The papyrus volumes of GREGORY I.'s 
registry have still been extant in the 9th century..., the registry of URBAN II. and of most of 
the popes of the 12th century were still extant in the first half of the 13th century in ROME..., 
in the 14th century, they were lost, as Sickel suspects, gone under in the urban ROMAN 
confusion of the 13th century."'’ Strange that, and how, the most valuable treasures of the 
papal archives, documents that were of the very highest significance, and therefore had to be 
guarded like eyeballs'’, could so disappear without a trace in such mysterious manner! On the 
other hand, the disappearance of the registry volumes, resting in the most secret archives of 
the popes, becomes easily intelligible if one considers that the ROMAN forgery headquarters 
did not even succeed in manufacturing flawless "genuine" registries for the last centuries of 
the Middle Ages. If it already requires a high degree of sharp wit and skill to flawlessly 
invent one document and one letter in all parts, then the forgery of a registry, reaching across 
years and decades, represents a Sisyphean work whose failure the forgery committee had to 
realise over time. If one did not want to offer a dangerous weak spot, one had no choice but 
to have the majority of the bungled registries disappear completely, and truly, the measly 
leftovers from allegedly the earlier centuries, on which endless work is wasted, but which 


nonetheless is woven so flimsily and clumsy that the make-up is still recognisable 


IV | haven't come across the equivalent English expression in all my years; eyeballs are crucial to humans which 
is why this German idiom has them guarded as something extremely valuable 


185 


everywhere, shows clearly how deplorable the state of the disappeared volumes must have 


been. 


1. Original registry and copies of the original registry. Original registries and 


original documents. 


The significance of a copy of an official document lies without question in the accurate and 
true reproduction of the original. A copy which, in its entire disposition and design, identifies 
itself as such, therefore shows a completely true repetition of all substantial elements of the 
original particulars. In letters and documents, such substantial elements are location and time 
of creation, naming the recipient of the letter or document, and naming the originator. Now 
first a comparison of the original registry with a copy of the registry. So, we will observe a 
copyist at work. With the GREGORY registry, we are in a position to be able to compare the 
"original" with a copy of this registry allegedly of the 12th century, and we expect that the 
copy goes exactly conform with its model source. As a matter of fact however, we bump into 
differences between original and copy, e.g. "very considerable textual deviations in the 
addresses" turn up. In one case, CASPAR has the following explanation for these differences 
at hand: after the copy had already been produced, a sheet has been removed from the 
original registry and been replaced with a newly written sheet, and from this, the address in 
the original is now truncated; later on then, another substitute sheet has been inserted in the 
original. (CASPAR, p 147) That sounds very evident and innocent, but this explanation 
attempt leaves quite unanswered how the guardians of the original registry could have hit 
upon removing a sheet from the registry in the first place and replacing it with another that 


shows deviations. 


A comparison of the registry entries with the preserved original pieces of the letters 


and documents brings results to light that are liable to increase our mistrust to the utmost: it 


186 


has turned out that original documents, not at all rarely, strikingly differ from the relevant 
entries in the registry. On this point, BRESSLAU comments: "We cannot miss changes in the 
wording in the cases in which we are able to compare preserved originals with the registry 
copies. They are not only found in the dating, but also in other parts of the documents; if they 
haven't been proven particularly often, it is partly due to the fact that an accurate comparison 
of the original texts with the registry texts has only become possible at all since the most 
recent registry editions." (URKUNDENLEHRE 1, p 148) Such deviations in the date particulars, 
e.g., we also find in the GREGORY registry and some corresponding originals; why, it happens 
that the original does not possess any dating at all while the registry copy does show date 
entries. (CASPAR, p 186) FICKER reports about another case'*: "If we find a date entry in the 
preserved originals different to the one in the register, such as B no. 2928 and 2938, entered 
in the register to the 5th July, in the originals dated 7th and 10th July..., it shows that little 
importance was placed on naming the exact same date in the registers as in the original 
issues." ZATSCHEK”’ offers further examples from the GREGORY registry for these tactics of 
different (elastic) dating of the original on the one hand, and the relevant entries in the 
registry on the other. We prick up our ears when e.g. PFLUGK-HARTTUNG proclaims as a 
general result: "The most severe deviations between registry and original issues are found in 
the address and the date! Names and dates! We remember where the most vulnerable parts of 


the invented tradition are to be found! 


Now comes quite an amazing observation which refers to the relation of the original 
registry of Gregory VII. to the mentioned copy of this registry, and which has us recognise 
the true nature, namely the forgery of the registry, like under a spotlight. We hear: "CASPAR 
was able to establish a hand-writing (copy) of the GREGORY registry in TROYES which does 
not show a larger number of changes in the original. Since this script already belongs to the 


12th century, the corrections in the original registry must belong to later times."”° So: the 


187 


GREGORY registry sure must have originated as an original already during GREGORY's times, 
in the 11th century. In the 12th century, a copy (the script from TROYES) of the original is 
being produced. Now, this copy does not yet have a number of corrections, which however 
the original does show, from which thus follows that the corrections in the original (!) must 
have turned up after the completion of the copy, thus quite some time after the setup of the 
original! — We remember the discussion from Chapter 10, Book 2, and we know what this is: 


double-entry book-keeping! Late "corrections"! In the original!! 


2. Fragmentary registration 
Without question , the maintenance of a registry is purposeful and makes sense only if all 
issued original pieces of an originator, or at least all important outgoings are entered. With 
regards to this point, how does it stand with the papal registries? Here, it is not only certain 
that by no means all outgoings are entered in the registry (of both John VIII. and Gregory 
VII), but that even important pieces have not been entered. Still today, we possess over 50 
GREGORY letters, handed down only outside of the registry, amongst them documents of 
great importance. E.g. in GREGORY's register — which, according to CASPAR and PERTZ, is to 
be regarded as the original main registry, which thus represents not perhaps merely a 
compiled collection — "the letter of justification, handed down by several authors, which 
GREGORY sent to Germany after HENRY's ban on the Lenten Triodion [Synod of fasting?] of 
1076" (CASPAR, p 197), is missing. In the face of such fact, one is wondering in amazement 
just what purpose such gap-laden registry maintenance was meant to serve at all? 
LOWENFELD” hits the nail on the head when he remarks: "However, how could the pope 
(GREGORY VII.) have referenced the registry if he didn't assume that one entered all 
documents originating from the curia?" If one then adds to this, that the register scribes — as 
we have found out in the previous sequence — placed "little importance" on the conformance 


of the entries with regards to the original addresses and dates, one is almost lead to believe 


188 


that the entire registry maintenance has been undertaken as some kind of sport. The 
GREGORY registry, with regards to its gap-fulness, does not perhaps stand alone. In JOHN 
VIIL.'s registry, too, "important pieces are missing which are preserved as recipients' 
tradition"; in that, "a consciously working principle of the selection (in the registry) is not 


detectable." 


Arbitrary changes of the original dates and addresses in the registry copies! 


Fragmentary registration! Two aspects suited to further feed our suspicion. 


3. Mistakes, corrections and gaps in the registries 


If one looks at the formal make-up of the papal registries, if one checks e.g. the hand-writing, 
what is striking is the extraordinary accuracy and care with which the registry scribes have 
carried out their entries. One can see at first glance, the scribes took it on them with pain- 
staking efforts, and have painted every letter with the most finicky accuracy. That is not only 
the case with JOHN's and GREGORY's registries. RODENBERG” passes judgement on the 
registries of HONORIUS II., GREGORY IX. and INNOCENZ IV., too: "The entries themselves 
are, in line with their official character, made with extraordinary accuracy." It must all the 
more be startling to hear that these official writings show a lot of mistakes, corrections, and 
gaps or late entries, respectively. In JOHN VIII's registry, which, note well, is not supposed 
to be the original but a copy, research is in the pleasant position to be able to heap all the 
blame onto the evil copyist: "Mistakes and imperfections are those of the copyist. Especially 
with proper names (1), i.e. predominantly in the addresses, one meets senseless forms which 
can only be explained as mis-readings; one bumps into flightyness such as the leaving out of 
single words or even the skipping of entire lines, flightyness which only a copy can show." 
(CASPAR, p 92) Such mistakes are in no way singular occurrences; much rather, they reach 


"into the countless"! It comes across as very strange to further hear at the same moment that 


189 


the flighty copyist has however worked, at the same time, very carefully and accurate: "In 
another respect, the scribe proves to be very conscientious (!). When he was unable to 
decipher one or more words, he has, without perhaps the attempt to hide it, left a gap... He 
has even had the intention to reproduce his model source as true as possible in all external 
attributes..." Accordingly, as already mentioned, also the hand-writing in the JOHN registry is 


finically proper and calliographically excellent. 


This strange psychological mix of flightyness and conscientiousness is no longer 
unknown to us: we have already recognised it as the characteristic state of mind of learned 


forgers! 


Research attributes the numerous defects in the JOHN registry to the flightyness of the 
copyist. It now appears most embarrassing having to establish the reprimanded defects: 
mistakes, corrections etc., in GREGORY VII.'s original registry, too. "In numerous places (in 
the GREGORY registry), corrections in the text of the letters and additions of individual words 
can be found." (CASPAR, p 152) These corrections stem in part from the registrar himself, 
partly other correctors after him have attended to their duty. (p 161) We particularly prick up 
our ears on CASPAR's following statement: "At times, in the place of names and dates, a gap 
has been left." The so-called 9th book of the registry, too, claims attention. The individual 
numbers of this book are supposed to not have been entered consecutively, as it was the rule, 
but all at once in bulk. Why? CASPAR reckons, because during the restless political times of 
the last years, GREGORY's regular registry maintenance had been disabled for him. That 
however does not fit the fact that "GREGORY's escape to SALERNO is accompanied by a last 
brief reinstatement of the registry activity", and that on this occasion — that is, during the 
escape — the 9th book was supposed to have been filled in. But let us assume for a moment 
that the 9th book has really been transferred to the registry during the escape days. It could 


then not make any wonder that the script, created under such adverse conditions, is riddled 


190 


with mistakes. However, what does make us very much wonder is to hear that our registrar 
despite of his hurry and flightyness, wrote quite an excellent, finically accurate hand- 
writing!! Namely, according to CASPAR, the 9th book is filled in "graphically carefully, but 


textually, with many mistakes which required a later correction." 


Thus, the GREGORY registry shows a desperate likeness to that of JOHN. GREGORY'S 
registrars have revealed themselves to be mental twins of the copyists of JOHN's registry. All 


of them possess the same remarkable psychological mix: conscientiousness and flightyness! 


4. Chronological confusion in the registries 


The state of the chronology in the papal registries has always caused research some strong 
headache. With regards to the chronology, there rules a Babylonian confusion in some parts. 
In line with the nature of the matter, the registration of the individual pieces occured, as a 
rule, in the chronological order of their issue. However, this principle did, that is, in all 
registries, ongoingly experience offences. EWALD” comments e.g. on the chronology of 
GREGORY L.'s registry: "[...] that next to the serious intent to only attribute the associated 
letters to each year of indiction, there rules a certain recklessness in the reception of the 
letters." How far this recklessness has gone, one can see, according to EWALD, from the fact 
"that 3 letters in the registry appear double, that is, twice in different indictions". An 
interesting finding, indeed. RODENBERG™ reports to us that things do not stand any better 
with the chronology of the registry entries of the 13th century, either: "It deserves to be 
highlighted that e.g the pieces of the 3rd year [of] INNOCENZ IX. which stand (belated by a 
whole year!) in the 4th book, and those of the 4th year which (again, belated by a year) stand 
in the 5th book, could have very well been put into the correct books; because at the end of 
both books, there is still sufficient room available. It is easy to see how little one cared for the 


correct order, and the impression is gained as if one was solely striving for processing the 


191 


material which had to be registered, which was there and the way it was there, as quickly as 
possible, without even having created an approximate order by dates. This is particularly 
prevalent in the last parts of some books, such as Liber III-VI of INNOCENZ IV.'s registries, 
where one "amongst the letters of June, one meets letters from all remaining parts of the 
year, which appear inserted quite randomly... The simplest explanation is that one was 
catching up with remainders, that one entered the drafts without much paying attention to the 
chronological order." Oh no, the explanation is by no means quite so simple! Firstly: 
INNOCENZ IV.'s registrar, too, knew that the nature of the institution of the registry and the 
purpose of the registration required chronologically correct entries. If he now, despite this, in 
the alleged catching up on remainders, wildly mixed the pieces up, one doesn't know over 
what to wonder more, the sloppyness and laziness of the scribe — to whom the order of the 
pieces was easy work — or the indifference and patience of the head of the chancery to whom 
the registrating civil servant dared present such flighty work. Secondly: one does the registrar 
injustice if one accuses him of flightyness. As the script illustrates, he has "carried out" the 
entries "with extraordinary accuracy". Thus, we get again entangled in the well-known 
psychological dilemma! Thirdly: our "flighty-accurate" registry scribe has conspicuously 
many twin brothers! A// registry scribes of the Middle Ages resemble him like one chicken's 
egg does the other. One almost wants to believe in a secret conspiracy of the registrars of all 
medieval centuries: whenever at all a registrar had to catch up with some alleged remainders, 
he always enters such remainders chronologically un-orderly and textually faulty, but in 


finically clean hand-writing! This sure must make one think then. 


I pick out an example of the registry of JOHN VIII. In this registry, the group of the 
so-called travel letters sticks out. These are over 70 letters which are supposed to originate 
from during the pope's journey to TROYES to the synod. Among those letters rules the "most 


complete chronological confusion". There are consecutive series (CASPAR, p119) of, for 


192 


example, pieces of November-December, June-July, August, June, December, September, 
August. CASPAR offers the following explanation: "During the unrest und haste of the year of 
travel, or perhaps because the competent civil servants weren't present, one did not regularly 
maintain the registry, but collected the draft material. Later, probably only after the return to 
ROME, one has then entered it late and in a hurry, without taking the time to bring any order 
into the randomly piled up draft notes, so mechanically and thoughtlessly (sic!) that the 
double draft of no.s 121, 120 was not even recognised as such, but booked as two letters in 
the wrong order, so hastily that an accidental skipping from one draft to the next, which 
carried the same address, was possible." Indeed, a scribe could barely have worked any more 
unorderly and flightily! What however, if it could be proven that our registrar must have yet 
worked with deliberation? One is to once again have a look at the already listed order of the 
registered pieces. There, pieces follow each other from November-December (internally, in 
order!), June-July (internally, in order !), August (correct succession on June-July) etc. 
Although in this series, the succession viewed as one overall chain appears unsystematic, 


there is however, a planful order unmistakeable in the individual links of the chain! 


One needs to be no prophet to be able to foresee that in all medieval papal registries, 
the chronology must show dodgy spots. And he who has wandered the investigation path with 
me, also knows why that is so. The impossibility to erect an in all parts robust and flawless 
chronological frame, to create it from nothing, forced the humanism forgers to utilise 
practices which appeared suitable to paint over the many defective parts in the chronology, if 
possible. Naturally, the best way out was to not add any date at all to the letters. Let us hear 
RODENBERG” about the dating of the registries of the 13th century: "The register letters are 
(as arule) dated. We do indeed meet some, yes, entire groups, which are dated incompletely 
or not at all... Also, sometimes, the exact dating has consciously been relinquished..., one 


has given the dating of the first letter a general date, without worrying that it [the general 


193 


date] was not accurate for all pieces." In GREGORY L.'s registry, in two excerpts of this 
registry actually, which EWALD” denotes 'Pa' and 'Pb', a particularly interesting trick has been 
worked with: "The same dates have been placed in Pa as final date of the previous letter, in 
Pb as start date of the following.", as ERHARD guesses, for the reason that already in the 
archetype of the registry, which served Pa and Pb as model source, the dates were attached 
"ambiguously", by standing between two letters without being specified any further". 
Ambiguity! We are bumping into a forgers' trick here, with which we have already occupied 


ourselves in the 10th chapter of Book 2. 


In quite childish fashion, JOHN VIII.'s registry attempts to circumnavigate the 
chronological cliffs. Here one finds, in a whole number of pieces, the short, innocent looking 
formula: "data ut supra", i.e. "date as above", "date as the above letter". This flimsy hint now 
is, as CASPAR has investigated, "completely senseless"! Any which way one may want to 
twist and elucidate, in most cases, the entry can in no circumstance be correct. (CASPAR, p 


103, 131) 


5. Ambiguity. Double-entry book-keeping. Disharmony of names and dates. 


For a better understanding, it is necessary to look further afield a little. The disharmony 
between names and dates (events and dates), which is observable every step along the way, 
jointly plays primarily the traitor on the artificial-learned birth of medieval history. What is to 
be understood by disharmony of names (events) and dates? Answer: The irreconcilability, the 
non-conformance of an event or name with a certain date. Example: a medieval pope cannot 
write a letter to the participants of a synod in spring of a certain year if that synod has 
congregated only in autumn of the assumed year. Or: this pope cannot address a letter to an 
archbishop X in A, at a time at which this X is still bishop in B. Or: no man can appear as 


participant of a medieval Imperial diet, who, according to "real" news of the time, has already 


194 


dies. As has been said, the paper tradition is crawling with such disharmonies and data — a 
phenomenon which can no longer surprise us, for it is tightly connected with the nature of the 
universal history fictionalisation. With the enormous scope, which the universal action had 
taken on during its course, an error-free, hundredfold and yet more hundredfold inter- 
weaving and entangling of the invented names and dates meant a task at which all art and 
caution had to fail. In this, it has to be considered that the enterprise stretched across decades, 
and that thus, the second and third forger generation had to continue building on an in many 
ways unfinished and shaky foundation, aided merely by a basic plan which contained only 
the main threads. The individual forgery sections may well have been maintaining an ongoing 
lively exchange of thoughts, and may well have put up the utmost conceivable effort to work 
towards each other: however, as human beings with a finite mental horizon, their strength 
was insufficient to overview the whole thing in brightness at every moment of the mightily 


urging concept, and to incorporate every detail into the realm of consideration. 


The history fabulists have left no stone unturned, to avoid, to solve or to veil the 
disharmonies where possible. A very frequently trodden path consists of ignoring one of the 
two factors (name or date) partly or entirely. With a letter for example, the sender and 
recipient are named, but a date is not given; or the sender and the date are told, but the 
recipients name left out; or only the date is given, while on the other hand, neither sender, nor 
recipient are mentioned by name. This trick has come into use particularly in copy books and 


registries, but with such striking consistency, that one can sense the intent with a stick. 


For now, the script n. 5077 of the court library in VIENNA shall be mentioned, which 
contains a collection of documents, predominantly of the popes of the 14th and 15th century. 
Through CHROUST, we find out about this collection: "The opening protocol is left out, not 
infrequently, the harangue is also missing, and usually, the closing protocol, including the 


dating, as well. On the other hand, virtually never is the attempt being made to suppress 


195 


proper names."*’ Tn this context, the JOHN registry with its "data ut supra" entries has to also 
once more be referred to: because here, as a rule, sender and recipient are named, the date has 


to vanish in the form of a nullity of information. 


Another frequently used veiling trick consists of the "accidentally" two-fold listing of 
a document, a letter, in a copy book or registry. In the literary tradition as well, in the annals, 
chronicles etc., the "accidentally" twice ore more listed fact — but the second time modified! — 
plays a predominant part. Earlier (Book 2), I have already shown this phenomenon, and 
referenced an example from the FULDA ANNALS. That in these cases, and the ones still to be 
discussed, we are not dealing with "accidents" and flightiness, but that conscious deliberation 
has been at work, is proven by the variations which is offered by the second showing of the 
same play. Exactly in order to introduce such variations, one resorted to double-entry book- 
keeping! Very often, the deviation of the second text does not occur in the actual text, but 
only in "trifles", such as the name of a person or place, the dating etc. The following example 
originates from the letter book of JOHN OF ARBOIS: "A letter of the King of Armenia to 
CLEMENS V. is found complete fol. 7-7'; the scribe begins it once again fol. 8'. After two 
lines, he realises his own thoughtlessness (sic!) and breaks off this second copy, leaving back 


in these two lines no less than four, in part significant variations compared to the first 


9128 


copy. 


We have already found confirmed, by one example from GREGORY VII.'s registry, 
that these tactics of deliberate ambiguity are also found in the papal registries. In JOHN VIII.'s 
registry, "several numbers further, a letter has been copied once again up to perhaps the 
middle of the text, where suddenly, if breaks off mid-sentence". (CASPAR, p 113) 
RODENBERG”’ mentions the case "that two identical letters are issued under different dates". 
GREGORY VIL.'s registry contains a difficult riddle for historical research: GREGORY's election 


is reported on twice, once in the so-called "election protocol", then in several letters of 


196 


GREGORY. "Undeniably, a certain contradiction has emerged in the registry, between the 
election protocol and the immediately following letters, in which GREGORY describes his 
election substantially differently. One has referenced especially this contradiction (once one 
saw a copy in the registry) for the character of the protocol as a forgery. Now (that the 
registry is acknowledged as the original), the question emerges whether GREGORY himself 
has ordered the registration of the protocol, or whether we are dealing with the arbitrariness 


of the victorious election party." (CASPAR, p 203, footnote 4) 


This type of question by CASPAR is a true textbook example, just with how little 
sound common sense nowadays "exact" research approaches their problems. CASPAR is once 
wondering whether not perhaps GREGORY himself has effected the registration of the 
protocol? Oh no, GREGORY surely has not been so dumb to then have his quite differently 
worded letters registered after the protocol, so that now his famous registry, in this place, 
eternalises the grossest contradictions finely obvious, black on white. And an election party 
was supposed to perhaps have the protocol "arbitrarily" inserted in the registry?? Without 
then getting the obvious idea to thoroughly weed out the contradicting letters instead?? 
Remarkable psychology in medieval ROME, too. But we need not shake our heads for very 
long over the here once again surfacing retardedness of medieval humans, already so familiar 
to us. The fact that here in the GREGORY registry, two grossly contradicting reports are 
standing (and despite the later correction of the register — see above p 30 — are still standing 
prettily!), proves that double-entry book-keeping was at work here in full deliberation — on 


the part of the late medieval forgery association of course. 


6. Late entries of dates and names in the registry 


If e.g. the GREGORY registry is a fruit of the forgers from the universal enterprise, we are 


permitted, without being clairvoyant, to prophesy that certain black marks of the forgery, the 


197 


way we have already discovered abundantly with documents and chronicles, will have to be 
found in this registry as well. It cannot surprise us at all anymore to hear from ZATSCHEK 
(I.c., p 59) that on the basis of the hand-writing findings, "there cannot be any doubt that the 
dating in the GREGORY registry has often been entered late (!), often in two paragraphs". (!!) 
Look at that! What STHAMER (comp. Book 2, ch. 4) first discovered in the way of 
"doubtlessly genuine" documents from the SICILIAN chancery of CHARLES I., then later found 
confirmed in the entire stock of documents from FRANCONIAN times right down to the 15th 
century: late entry of the dating, the same forgery tactics reveal themselves in the papal 
registry as well! Even frequently, the date entries in the registry were entered late "in two 
paragraphs"! And with all of that, the horrible chronological confusion which yet still rules 
in the registry! So, as was not to be expected any differently, the fathers of the great 
enterprise, in casting the papal registry volumes, also stumbled over the fatal obstacle of the 


chronology. 


To the following finding, we also nod, satisfied and with a sense of understanding. 
"Still, it remains conspicuous that in the original registries up to 1200, the short addresses did 
not simultaneously (!) get on the parchment with the registry text. In GREGORY VIL.'s 
registry, there must be decades (!!) between." (ZATSCHEK, l.c., p 63) Indeed, that does remain 
— if the registries were authentic — very conspicuous still. Noteworthy people, these registrars. 
When they made their entries, they always left out the short addresses at first (just as in most 
cases the dating as well). Sure, how were they supposed to know addresses and dating?? But 
hold it: they must have been able to gather this from the pieces that have been presented to 
them for the purpose of entering! That, they were simply unable to do, because then, they 
surely would have also written the dating and addresses from the model source into the 
registry book. So, the composers of the model sources were so sloppy that they gave pieces to 


the registry which were only half finished! There, the registrars then waited several decades, 


198 


until they had somewhat found an agreement with the other chancery civil servants over such 
horribly difficult things! And even then, they still committed those many blunders. Even 
revisers did not make a better job of it. Namely, with regards to INNOCENZ III's registry, we 
find out that in the dating, first an "accident" of the registrar, and then still an "accident" of 
the reviser have occurred.*° And all the while, on the part of the researchers, we keep 


continually hearing of the excellent organisation of the papal chancery.*' 


At the end, we have to still examine the most difficult problem of nowadays registry 
research, at the solution of which the researchers flat out despair. The utilised "sparkling 
shiny and razor-sharp" methods of nowadays pseudo-critique, in this point, unearthed the 
famous results which are characterised by violently contradicting each other. It is about the 
question: by what actually, was the registration carried out, by the finished original (of the 
letters, diplomas), or by the concept (draft of the letters etc.) Already, that such a question can 
at all emerge, startles us. Should the chancery civil servants of the curia have been that 
bunny-brained then, that they would eternalise half-finished drafts neatly and orderly in the 
registry? Yes, so tell us many registry experts, it must have been so. On this, ZATSCHEK 
makes himself heard as follows: "Who wants to inform themselves whether the papal 
registries were maintained by originals or drafts, will have to establish a quite peculiar 
insecurity (!) in the literature. Arguments for the registry maintenance by drafts, by originals, 
have been presented by the most varying sides, the rift reaches back still into the 19th 
century, and has only been deepened in recent years." (ZATSCHEK, l.c., p 37) The rift over 
this question has indeed been deepened so far that today, two researcher camps are at 
loggerheads so strongly divided, that any reconciliation at all can be ruled out. The amusing 
thing in this: each party is in the right, however, only ever to fifty percent. We need not spend 


all that much time in this double-mill. The solution to the great riddle is this: registration was 


199 


done by neither original, nor by the draft, but the papal registries have been registered, i.e. 


fabricated, by the imagination of the late medieval forgery associates. 


The result of our investigation consists of the evidence, to be expected from the 
beginning, that the papal registries have been coined with the to us well-known marks of 
CAIN of learned forgery work in the most desirable clarity. All these characteristic marks: 
contradictions, on the one hand between original registry and registry copies, on the other 
hand between registry entries and "original" pieces; fragmentary registration; mistakes, 
corrections, gaps and late entries; confusion in the chronology; multiple-entry book-keeping, 
and not least the peculiar zigzag-psychology of the retarded registry scribes - are towering 
witnesses for the artificial birth of the registry volumes. Now, since the papal registries, as 
history researchers tell us, represent the axis and the centre of all medieval tradition, their 
forgery thus proves for one thing that Rome had participated in the great forgery action; 
but this circumstance now has us raise the question whether not perhaps ROME (the curia) had 


the leading role of the whole movement? 


4. 


The lack of secular registries and archives 


Could ROME (the curia) have played a or even the leading part in the great forgery enterprise? 
That was the question at the end of the previous chapter. The answer to this question is from 
now on the target of all further examinations, the now following as well, which has to deal 


with an interesting statistical problem. 


200 


Historical research, always ready to deny the most fundamental laws of experience 
and reason, out of due respect for the "empirically" given tradition, contented themselves in 
many cases by establishing a striking phenomenon in the stock of the tradition as a "fact" 
which the historian will have to accept. The papal curia has, since the earliest times, run a 
registry about their chancery outgoings, as we can see from the preserved leftovers, and as we 
can conclude from miscellaneous news. Good! says the historian, the curia has simply 
already very early recognised the great importance of registry maintenance, without which an 
orderly administration is of course impossible. In this respect, how do things stand now with 
the registration activity in the chanceries of the German Kings and Emperors? There, the 
general findings of the tradition teach us that the German rulers, almost up the threshold of 
modern times, did not place any value on maintaining registries. There are neither 
registries or registry fragments preserved, nor are there any other signs of registration 
activity perceivable in the secular chanceries. Although this fact causes a surprise, the 
historians explain, it stands unshakeable; it simply proves that the Kings and Emperors, 
certainly much to their own detriment, had no concept of the significance and the manifold 


advantages of registry maintenance! 


BRESSLAU™, in his URKUNDENLEHRE, goes on about this point as follows: "In SICILY, 
FREDERIC II. has introduced registry maintenance..., we possess a fragment that comprises 
the time from October 1239 to the beginning of June 1240." The successors, too, kept the 
custom. "Then, with the year 1265, the series of ANGOVINIAN registries begins, which, still 
now, comprises over 380 volumes" ... "That now however, the custom of registry 
maintenance proven for SICILY, had been transferred to the Empire as well under FREDERIC 
II. already, that thus, the issued documents of this Emperor for Upper and Middle Italy and 
Germany had been registered as well, is neither established nor likely at all. Because in the 


Middle Ages, once the custom of registration had been introduced in a chancery, it has not 


201 


been given up again. However, we have no indication whatsoever that in Germany under 
HENRY VII., KONRAD IV., and the Kings of the interregnum, RUDOLF I., ADOLF, ALBRECHT 
I., registries were maintained. It was only with HENRY VII.'s chancery that a registry was 
maintained, "but nothing of this registry has been preserved, and what its fate may have been 
after the Emperor's death, remains hidden from us." ... "The custom has then been kept in the 


chancery of his successor on the throne, LUDWIG THE BAVARIAN." 


Indeed, the Kings of France have yet been sooner at hand to secure for themselves the 
advantages of registry maintenance. A document and registry volume is preserved, 
originating from the court of the King of France, allegedly from the year 1204, and from that 
point in time onwards, "the custom of registration has been kept in the French chancery." 
(BRESSLAU, p 124) And in Italy, there are even "registries known, officially maintained by 
the notary for the documentation, taken on by him, of legal business, since the middle of the 
12th century."*? Thus, it would have required a timespan of centuries, until the realisation of 
the high significance of orderly registry activity had reached across the Alpes from ROME 
into the heads of the German Kings and Emperors! While in Italy every notary has run their 
registry already in the 12th century, the German rulers could bring themselves to burdening 


their chancery civil servants with such "useless" paperwork only in the 14th century!! 


As the historians have come to tell, the Western Princes in the Middle Ages 
altogether, on this side of the Alpes, have never understood that a written parchment, and be 
such a thing decorated with a dozen seals, should have attributed any value to it, that it could 
be worth to be concerned with their careful storage. The clergy may guard those papers 
cautiously, the Kings and Emperors had no idea of joining in nurturing such fancies. If 
someone does not believe it, they may ask the historians! There, he will hear that the 
testaments for the existence of a papal archive, i.e. a collection of all letters, documents, 


registries, files etc. concerning the curia, carefully stored in dedicated spaces, originate from 


202 


as early as the 5th century, and that since the times of INNOCENZ I., the popes themselves 
have referenced their archives in their decisions. "Quite after the example of the papal chair, 
bishopric and monastery churches, too, since the oldest times, have taken precautions for the 
storage of their document stock... that it was like that everywhere (in the clerical 
institutions), is best proven by the preserved originals which in Germany, as well as in France 
and Italy, frequently reach back to the times of the foundation of the relevant establishments 
themselves."** Incomprehensibly, the secular Princes on the other hand, as historical research 
patronises us, have not in the slightest taken any serious measures to secure the preservation 
of their documents and files. " For long centuries, Italy's and Germany's secular rulers have 
indeed, to their own detriment, shown a lack of equal care for the storage of their documents 
and files... Only in CAROLINGIAN times, we hear of an archive, albeit this cannot yet be 
regarded as truly orderly archive work." (BRESSLAU, p 161) And the historians believe to 
have found an explanation for this striking phenomenon; they pass the blame for the non- 
existence of archives of German Kings and Emperors to the fact, "that due to the lack of a 
permanent residence of the Princes, the archival materials, together with the chanceries, 
tagged along on travels and war campaigns, and thus fell to displacement and destruction."* 
This is supposedly the reason why "under the OTTONIANS and SALIANS any trace of an 
Imperial archive vanishes." "In reality, on can talk of a permanent Imperial archive only from 


the year 1422." (BRESSLAU, p 169) 


And may all these research results be much of a surprise, historical science finds 
itself, under the pressure of its methodical principles, forced to accept them as "historical 
facts". On the one hand now, without a question, the lack of registries and archives of secular 
rulers is a fact, but simply and solely a fact of written tradition, i.e. a literary fact. However, 
whether the literary fact is also a real-historical fact, is yet an open question whose answer 


depends on the result of an appeal to reason. 


203 


I am yet inclined to believe that the conscience of reason is stirring within nowadays 
historical researchers as well, when they proclaim the discussed literary defects to be 
historical facts. On the one hand, the historian has pacifying reasons at the ready, the most 
prominent of which, in this case as well, they consider to be the hint at the abundance and the 
generality of the phenomenon, on the other hand, they have to admit themselves, that the 
secular Princes' neglect, with regards to registry maintenance and archives, is difficult to 
understand. It would indeed have been a wondrous state of affairs of the psychology of the 
medieval Princes, if the findings of the written tradition would have to be regarded as 
historical reality: we couldn't help ourselves but to declare these rulers pure fools. General 
experience teaches that man becomes smarter via damage’ - but if it is supposed to be "true 
and real" that almost through all centuries of the Middle Ages, Kings and Emperors did not 
have registries maintained, and no archives established, then we would stand before the 
extraordinary fact "that entire generations of a certain category of humans, by exceedingly 
high and ongoing damage, would not have grown one bit smarter! Because about the 
enormous, manifold advantages of papal registry maintenance and archives, there can be no 
doubt, but also, on the other hand, equally none about the painfully emerging disadvantages 
in all areas, administration, judicature etc., from lack of these institutions in the realm of 
secular chanceries. One is to imagine this thing in practice. For example, the task was to 
regain Imperial income which had earlier been sold or pawned once; then it was sure 
necessary to possess any document-based knowledge of the deed in the first place. Then one 
is to realise that, according to the tradition, the two highest powers, Emperordom and 
popedom, were locked in constant fighting like two armies, always with the intent of finding 
new ways to weaken the opposition. And there, Emperordom should have remained 


indifferent and backwards, note: centuries long, when it hat to painfully experience that the 


V German proverb: 'aus Schaden' wird man klug,; lit. 'from damage, one grows smart’; indicating that a 
detrimental experience prompts you to learn from it, so as to not incur the damage next time. 


204 


opposition was deploying a new, dangerous weapon in the fight? In all important negotiations 
and contracts between Emperor and pope, in all disputes between church and Empire, a 
dominance of the church then emerges most dramatically every time when — as for example 
with the contract of ANAGNIE in the year 1176 between FREDERIC I. and pope ALEXANDER 
III. — the curia referred to the canonic collections and presented the Emperor with the dug-up 
privileges in order to reinforce their claims. The ROMAN curia and all clerical institutions set 
up registries and archives, respectively, in order to justify their claims against the secular 
powers in the big as well as the small — and the Kings and Emperors were supposed to not 
have parried that thrust? Should it really not have occurred to the chancery staff of the secular 
rulers, exclusively originating from the clerical camp, and knowing the advantages of these 
institutions, or should they not have succeeded in convincing their Royal and Imperial 
masters of the necessity and the importance of such things? And if it is said that the lack of a 
permanent residence of the Princes were to blame for the archival materials being displaced 
and destroyed during travels and war campaigns, such explanation attempt appears of course 
ridiculous, because it goes without saying that the secular rulers did not lug around such an 
important treasure such as an archive on travels and war campaigns, but, equally as much as 
they took care of the safe storage of gold and silver, that they were intent on storing the 
collected files in a fixed and safe place as well. The popes were operating more smartly. 
"When CLEMENS V. moved to AVIGNON, he took the registries of his predecessors with him, 
while he had most of the other archival materials of the ROMAN church brought to the 


fortified Assisi." (NA‘!, Vol. X, p 573) 


If one had to accept the findings of the literary tradition as historical fact, one would 
have to, as said, accept that the medieval secular rulers were, one and all, childish fools, not 


to say semi-idiots. In anything and everything concerning business operations, the church

would have been miles ahead of the secular circles. While the curia, much as the clerical 
institutions per se, have maintained official protocols about all important (synods) and 
unimportant negotiations since the oldest times, the secular powers, according to tradition, 
would have regarded it a superfluous luxury fo set up official records on Imperial and 
election diets, still in the 15th century. If one wants to cause a historian a sleepless night, one 
has to only ask them about the /mperial laws of the earlier Middle Ages. Such an "only by 
chance" in a hidden codex preserved law, the so-called "P4CTUM" (NARRATIO DE ELECTIONE 
LOTHARII in the GOTTWEIG Codex No. 106)*%, is considered the "crux of the historians up to 
this day", because one does not know what to make of it. Happy over the rare find, one had to 
soon experience that one regards the PACTUM as a later addition to the NARRATIO, the next 
one as a misunderstanding, the third and fourth as an honest fraud or outright as a forgery. A 
forgery? Surely, that is hardly believable, one exclaims. "Publicistically, it would be an 
attempt with insufficient means, wanting to spread such tendencies or even the falsification of 
an Imperial law via a story which has never found its way out in the world, which has 
remained without any influence on politics and written history of the following times, of 
which the only script is preserved in a remote Austrian monastery together with clerical and 
classical authors in a codex... For the abbot, the monk, or whoever else was the narrator, 
what purpose would it have served to so grossly deceive the brothers of GOTTWEIG on this 
point?" Indeed, no abbot or monk of GOTTWEIG has invented the NARRATIO with the PACTUM, 


because that writing originates with the late medieval universal history invention enterprise. 


So, towards the end of the Middle Ages, the German Kings finally found it convenient 
to set up registries. Although the epiphany of the benefit of such things came to them pretty 
late, thank God, but it came at least. What did it now look like on the sheets of these 
volumes? Let us have ourselves an example presented, by SEELIGER®’, that is. 


(REGISTERFUHRUNG AM DEUTSCHEN KONIGSHOF BIS 1493 = REGISTRY MAINTENANCE AT 


206 


THE GERMAN ROYAL COURT UNTIL 1493) In one part, the entries under WENZEL lack "almost 
throughout the time details, and contented themselves with indicating occurring names by 
their initials". With this, the true nature of these registries, too, has unveiled itself for us: they 


are forgeries from the great action. 


Now, our attention is all taken up by the burning question: who has destroyed the 
medieval registries (and other archive stock) of the secular rulers? Since we, unlike the 
experts, as not being slaves to the tradition, don't have to kick around our sound common 
sense on historical problems, to us, the proven almost complete lack of secular registries of 
the Middle Ages does not mean that the secular rulers neglected registry maintenance from 
stupidity, but to us, this lack proves that such secular registries must have been 
systematically destroyed. It is now not to be presumed that an above the clouds throning 
swarm of spectres has descended, materialised, and [then] immaterialised the secular 
registries; why, surely, very real people must have played a part in the vanishing act. Now, 
how about the assumption that German (and other) Kings themselves ordered their registry 
volumes destroyed? They must have had very good reasons for such action. But which?? 
Why, we cannot find even one, or can we: bottomless stupidity! Because note: if the stupid 
Kings had destroyed their valuable volumes, the popes would have been permitted to 
triumph, because then, the curial registries as a weapon in the fight would have gained 
enormous significance. But let us remember that of course the preserved medieval registries 
of the popes are not authentic at all, but forged. Are we supposed to hazard the guess that the 
secular rulers, on the one hand, had their own and the papal (authentic) registries vanish, and 
have then, on the other hand, not perhaps for themselves, but — for the curia, new volumes 
forged?? Registries, which would have been used as a welcome weapon by ROME against 
them?? (Because assumed, these newly fabricated writings had been targeted against the 


power of the curia, the curia would not have guarded such dangerous things like treasure "in 


207 


their most secret archives", but self-evidently, swiftly committed them to fire.) Thus, it has 
been established: the Kings themselves could not have possibly destroyed their registry 


treasures. 


The answer to the question: who has had the registries vanish? can only be: the curia 
was the originator. Because only the curia itself could have forged their preserved medieval 
registry volumes, it has also had its hand in the destruction of the secular registries. The 
forged ROMAN fabrications would have betrayed themselves by their very existence, if the 


registries of the Kings had been preserved as contradicting counter-proof. 


5. 


ROME as headquarters of the medieval forgery action 


In viewing the curia in Rome as the headquarters of the late medieval history falsification 
enterprise, it may seem to be at odds with the result of the two previous chapters, that so far, 
few forgery cases of the highest clerical authority could be brought to light by historic-critical 
expert research. For this phenomenon however, the explanation is obvious: indeed, with their 
rusty methods, expert research has of course already discovered a stately number of the most 
clumsy document forgeries; however, it has considered these cases (e.g. the REICHENAU 
ones) "practical" occurrences, which is impossible, according to our examinations in Book 1. 
We have proven that all these forgeries due to their equal make-up must stem from one 
source — and that very source had sprung from the curia in ROME! Naturally, it was not 
possible for expert research, whose pseudo-critical method is calibrated only for isolated 


individual objects, to detect this location of the source. If in the previous chapter, we have 


208 


announced: whoever forged the papal registries, has also had the secular registries vanish, we 
are now forced to further conclude: and they have also fabricated the forged medieval 
mass of documents. This conclusion follows necessarily and irrefutably from the identity of 
the fabrication with regards to the forged papal registries and the remaining stock of all 


forged chronicles and documents. 


If so far, research has to register so few forgery cases especially in ROME, then that 
again only proves very intensely that their allegedly critical methods fail and must fail 
especially with problems which do not refer to something isolated, singular, but to something 
general. With their relative pseudo-methods, and from their many relative viewpoints, expert 
critique was of course e.g. in no position at all to even guess the forgery of the papal 


registries, let alone establish it. 


Beyond this yet, we will now, in the following, make the interesting and abundantly 
comical observation, how the expert historians, even when pushed directly to ROME as 


forgery headquarters, can only under difficulty man up to follow this direction of the path. 


We discuss the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS, the so-called CONSTANTINIAN 
DONATION and the forgeries of the BENEDIKTUS LEVITIKUS. The focus is on the questions: 


who has forged here? When have these things been fabricated? 


There is no educated human who would not have heard of two allegedly early 
medieval history falsifications, the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS and the forged so-called 
CONSTANTINIAN DONATION. Less known among non-historians are the systematic falsifications 
of BENEDIKTUS LEVITIKUS. These three extraordinary falsifications, allegedly staged during 
the early Middle Ages, in their ultimate objectives and purposes, reach way beyond the 
tendencies of the remaining allegedly medieval Jocal and regional forgeries: their focus is not 


the advantage of a church, a monastery, a certain bishopric, but they are striving for an 


209 


elevation of the overall church, i.e. ultimately a strengthening and consolidation of the 
highest clerical administration resorts, especially the enhancement of the power of ROME. So, 
these mystifications were initiated by ROME as the joint place of origin of the forgeries. 
According to ruling opinion, only with the CONSTANTINIAN DONATION, ROME would qualify as 
place of origin. But have the three forgery groups perhaps been created simultaneously? 
Impossible! the historians shout, and prove — on the basis of the findings of the tradition, and 
aided by their blind relative method! — that, since the three groups "turn up in the tradition" at 
different times, they must have thus been put into the world consecutively. But let us have a 


closer look at the forgeries. 


I. HINSCHIUS has "proven to the point of evidence of a scientifically certain fact"** that 
the authors of the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS have used the BENEDIKTINE CAPITULARIES as 
source; so, let the forgeries of the BENEDIKTUS LEVITIKUS be discussed first. On the so-called 
BENEDICT, I let FR MAASSEN do the talking*’: "The great FALSARIUS in the realm of legal 
sources... has, in the preface to his work, announced the latter as a collection of capitularies 
of PIPPIN, CHARLES THE GREAT and LUDWIG THE PIOUS. This information is well-known to be 
wrong. The compilation consists only to the smallest part of real capitularies, the vast 
majority of the chapters has been drawn from other, especially clerical, legal sources, a 
relatively small number is to be regarded as merely the product of BENEDICT's free invention. 
Since however the provenance of the individual chapters is withheld, they thus all appear in 
line with the specification outlined in the preface as capitularies of PIPPIN, CHARLES and 
LuDwia. The purpose of this great fraud follows from the contents of the false capitularies... 
Falsarius wanted to considerably increase the chances of a reform program of a big clerical 
party in the Empire, to which of course he belonged himself, by making the world believe 
that the individual postulates of this program had already been promoted to law status by the 


secular power. Thus it is the following points, which in the capitularies of BENEDIKT are 


210 


treated with particular preference: priority of the clerical over the secular legislation; 
exclusive competence of the apostolic chair for the causae maiores, in particular for the 
iudicia episcoporum; a requirement for the papal authorisation for the appointment of 
synods, and the confirmation of their decisions by the pope; the exclusion of secular 
judiciary over the clergy; foundation and consolidation of the primatial dignity. As coarse as 
the deception was: it succeeded. Beginning with the earliest even established quote (soon 
after creation), the chapters of the forger BENEDIKT have qualified as capitularies of the 
FRANCONIAN Kings: in council files, in secular laws, with authors, in legal collections. 


Through seven centuries and longer, no doubt has made itself known." 


Too bad that this shining vanishing artist BENEDIKT, in "history", has left no trace at 
all as an Earth citizen. He belongs to the legion of history writers of whom nothing or 
extremely little has been found out. These "medieval" authors emerge and whoosh out of a 
world of fog like spectres, create a work or two, and vanish without a trace. The false 
capitularies cannot have fallen out of the sky, they must have "one" author, that was supposed 
to be a certain BENEDIKT, research has been unable to find out more. One is to now once 
again take a look at the above listed main points of the BENEDIKTINE falsifications; they are 
allegedly postulates of a clerical reform party to which BENEDIKT belonged; now, our 
BENEDIKT could not have put up any other or better postulates — ifhe had been working in 
the pay of the papal curia! Or, with other words: everything speaks for the church per se, i.e. 
the curia jointly with the clerical hierarchy, having carried out the alleged BENEDIKTINE 
forgeries, and that all the more, because everything speaks against the authorship of the 
falsifications on the part of a quite obscure party man that BENEDIKT must have had been. In 
order to enhance the chances of a "party", someone, someplace, in a quite obvious fashion, 
undertakes a literary fraud of grand format; he foists in chapters, partly invented, partly 


drawn from clerical legal sources, as capitularies of the secular power. "As coarse as the 


211 


deception was: it succeeded." So, when BENEDIKT released his fabrication to the market, it 
did not occur to a single soul to ask for the sources of the capitularies and to investigate? 
Even the "opposition party" remained quiet as a mouse, had wool pulled over their eyes 
without defending themselves? That requires a degree of stupidity, dullness, indifference 
which cannot be expected from even the "naive" medieval spirits. However, that the curia 
had their hands in it, follows from the fact that ROME has delightedly taken care of the 
forgery rather than maybe angrily rejecting it. So, the obscure BENEDIKT and the curia were 


of one mind. Whether perhaps from pre-stabilised harmony?! 


II. Into his collection, pseudo-ISIDOR has also entered the forged CONSTANTINIAN 
DONATION document (the 'KONSTITUTUM'), which allegedly CONSTANTINE had issued to pope 
SILVESTER. As is well known, the document bestows upon the pope the primate over the 
entire church and the right of sovereignty over ROME. According to GRAUERT, the 
KONSTITUTUM 1s supposed to have "been composed in the FRANCONIAN Empire, namely the 
monastery of ST. DENYS, shortly before or simultaneously with the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN 
DECRETALS".”° According to the view of other historians however, the KONSTITUTUM, by its 
provenance, is not supposed to have anything to do with pseudo-ISIDOR, since "stock of 
vocabulary and language are different, the make-up of the forgery differs from pseudo- 
IsIDOR's method".*' LOENING”, E MEYER® and K WENCK™ represent the opinion that the 
forgery has been created in ROME, namely (according to LOENING), under PAUL I. or 
HADRIAN L., since firstly, "the use of numerous expressions, formulas, idioms, which are 
characteristic for the papal documents of those decades, proves that we have to look for the 
author in the circles closely related to the papal curia", and secondly, since "CONSTANTINE's 
territorial donation could be associated with the political events of that time". The strangest 
thing in the whole argument over the authorship of the forged donation document is the fact 


that the so obvious thought seems to not have occurred to anybody, to finish the question of 


212 


the authorship off by the famous "cui bono?". What is it actually supposed to mean when, 
according to LOENING, the author would have to be looked for "in the circles... closely 
related to the papal curia"?? Some cleric in ROME would have suddenly had the phantastic 
thought to make the papal chair a gift by way of a forged document? Why does LOENING not 
say what surely already automatically follows from the simple 'cui bono?': the forger is sitting 
in the papal curia! Or straight out: The curia itself has carried out the forgery in the interest 
of the overall church and in their primevally own interest! If we place next to this the most 
conspicuous "fact" of tradition, that the allegedly in the 8th century fabricated KONSTITUTUM, 
despite the document being found, besides in the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS, in still other 
scripts, has not been utilised at all by the popes for centuries, but has supposedly been 
referenced by the church for their purposes only since the middle of the 11th century, then the 
creation and origin of the donation document is no longer mysterious: the KONSTITUTUM 
represents a product of the universal history fictionalisation enterprise. However, our 
document was a botched forgery, or much rather, it turned out during the course of the 
enterprise that one would be best advised to transfer the relevant donation to the apostolic 
chair not to so early times — CONSTANTINE then probably was yet the man who was able to 
make his donation reality, and would have made it a reality! Then however, on the basis of 
such power of the Roman bishop, an entirely different history of the popes of the early 
Middle Ages, would have necessarily had to be invented, entirely different to the one that was 
needed, and had already in part strenuously been achieved. The botched forgery however, 
which was already firmly established in the mass of the tradition, was thus swiftly dropped 


and substituted with the forged later PIPPIN-CAROLINGIAN DONATION. 


If things stand like this, one fact is not surprising that may seem conspicuous enough 
for the historians, who have to produce so many pieces of evidence for the throughout 


uncritical spirit of the entire Middle Ages and still the Renaissance era, namely the fact that 


213 


the in-authenticity of the CONSTANTINIAN DONATION has sort of instinctively and clairvoyantly 
been foreseen and sensed by the else unbelievably uncritical medieval authors! As early as 
the 12th century, not only GERHOH VON REICHERSBERG denied the authenticity, but also 
OTTO VON FREISING, who has supposedly composed his chronicle between 1143 and 1146, 
does not hold back (IV,3) with his second thoughts about the CONSTANTINIAN DONATION. 
Naturally now, these splendid critics have been unable to criticise on a matter of the 12th 
century, which was only a product of the forgery action of the closing period of the Middle 
Ages. These reports on the critical streak of a GERHOH VON REICHERSBERG and others are 
fake news of the forgers' guild, too. And so it came, that, when during the era of humanism, 
the in-authenticity was "discovered" virtually epidemically — almost simultaneously by 
VALLA, by NIKLAUS VON CUES, by the English bishop REGINALD PEAKOCK — the curia did 
not appear at all surprised. VALLA has even been favoured by pope NICOLAUS V., and "has 
ended his days in peace as 'Kanonikus' at the Lateran.** By the way , FUETER's judgement on 
VALLA: "VALLA's critical works as such are of little significance, remarkable is actually only 


the courage of their author."*° With what "courage" the curia had filled him! 


3. [III.] A summary of the two discussed forgeries and their further development 
represent the PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS, that well-known collection, which contains a 
lot of forged decrees, which latter had supposedly been issued by the ROMAN bishops of the 
first three centuries. With this forgery, too, the with a true blindness cursed historical research 
has not worked out just where actually to look for the source of origin. From a variety of 
relative indications of the tradition, one has installed LE MANS, MAINZ, and REIMS as 
location of origin; the majority of researchers holds the opinion that "the" forger must have 
stood "in close relations" to the archdiocese REIMS. Time and again in the examinations, the 
purely hypothetical thought haunts from the background, that a clerical reform party could 


have pulled out those forgeries willy-nilly, because somewhere, a supporter of the party could 


214 


have resorted to the very useful means of forgery for the strong support of the movement. 
"Witnesses of its (the party's) existence and of the views it stood for, are the fictionalised 
legal sources.", says A HAUCK“’; thus, a remarkably shadowy, unreal and most of all, inactive 
party! "One is unable to follow their development in detail. But that it was extant, made itself 
noticeable ongoingly during later times."** Truly, a wondrous party that must have been that 
did not by any means make itself perceptible in the public, except by some poisonous forgery 
darts shot from the dark! With the false decretals as well, the 'cui bono?' could have given 
research the right hint, if the historians, instead of being slaves to the tradition, had appealed 
to their reason and living experience. The forged decretals are meant to generally benefit the 
overall church, but ultimately its highest authority, the papal curia, therefore, the hearth of 
the forgery action is to be found in ROME! Again, an obscure forger went "conform" with the 
curia. The ultimate objective of the forgery of the so-called BENEDIKT as well as that of the 
pseudo-ISIDOR is the creation of a powerful and independent popedom. According to pseudo- 
IsIDOR, the pope is "no longer a subject of the King, he is not only the head of the church, but 


the head of the entire world." (HAUCK, p 490) 


I conclude the discussion of the falsifications with a summarising comment by 
HAUCK on "the tangled question of the origin of the qualifying pseudo-epigraphical volumes 
of scripts", who, in this, has his eye also on the by us so far neglected false so-called 
CHAPTERS OF ANGILRAM: "T content myself by commenting that 1., I agree with the 
assumption, according to which the three forgeries originate from one author, or, as is 
perhaps more likely, of the same authors; 2., I therefore hold the opinion that the question of 
priority of the one or the other (forged) book cannot be properly solved ... Why, the forgeries 
have obviously been long prepared and carried out well-considered; the simultaneously (!) 
appearing works were meant to support each other; 3., 1 do not consider it probable that the 


forgeries were triggered by the intention to come to the aid of a certain personality in some 


215 


certain case... The authors did not want to support a temporarily hassled associate, but ease 
the acknowledgement of clerical claims which had already been raised." So, according to 
this, as early as the 8th century, with regards to the written tradition, a similar extraordinary 
event to that established by me for the era of the Renaissance and humanism would have to 
be established — albeit not on that large a scale: a super-regional systematic falsification of 
history. However, these forgeries could not have been fabricated in the 8th century; they must 
— just like medieval pseudo-history per se — originate from the fabrication headquarters of the 
late Middle Ages. The proof follows clearly from the following consideration: the forgery 
wave of the universal action aims temporally backwards, not only to the times of the 
CAROLINGIANS, MEROWINGIANS, but (as will be shown in Book 4) to the times of CAESAR 
and TACITUS; the forgery action reached back to the re-forging of the ROMAN authors writing 
about GERMANIA. Now, in this manner of the falsification of the entire history of the Middle 
Ages, no independently of this, allegedly in the 8th century occurring, action could have 
remained neglected, but this small wave is incorporated in the one big flood. Our in this 
chapter discussed forgeries must be results of the late medieval universal action, since they 
are organically connected with the remaining forgeries in the now extant pseudo-history. But 


our question: who has forged here? is answered thus: here, too, ROME was the originator. 


6. 


The point in time/timespan of the forgery action 


Humanism, Renaissance, and — history falsification! The fact of the intimate interwovenness 


of these terms has long been recognised by historical research. One has found: "It cannot be 


216 


denied, that in the humanist direction (of history-writing), there lay the tendency, at times, to 
grant too much power to the imagination, and to fill gaps in the historical tradition with 
arbitrary fictionalisations."*”” History falsification not as a random and rare phenomenon, but 
as a tendency of the times! That is the one thing. And the other is no less important: Italy as 
place of origin and starting point of this tendency! "Italy may pride itself having initiated, 
next to humanist historiography, humanist source falsification, too."*° Let us first mention 
one of the great forgers whose forgeries fall into the literary category of the historic tradition, 
and which are suited to serve us revealing the nature of the humanist history falsifications. I 


follow the passage that FUETER gives in his historiography about this forger. 


"A DOMINICAN, the humanist ANN/US OF VITERBO (actually Giovanni Nanni; born 
around 1432 in VITERBO, 1499 named "Magister sacri palatii' by ALEXANDER VI., died 1502 
to ROME) is the first forger in the new style. His ANTIQUITATUM VARIARUM VOLUMINA XVII 
CUM COMMENTARIIS (first ROME 1498) brought to light a series of deemed lost antique 
historical works (by BEROSUS, FABIUS PIETOR, CATO, MANETHO a.0.), which ANNIUS had 
allegedly found again. The forger's objective seems to have primarily been fo light up the 
dark, in which the history of the European nations/peoples before their first contact with the 
ROMANS is cloaked. Among all humanist inventions, his forgery probably stands highest, 
morally."*' Somebody who, around the year 1500 in ROME, fabricates allegedly antique 
historical works, invents e.g. a BABYLONIAN writer, BEROSUS, could of course not have put 
such mystifications into the work for the reason of surreptitiously obtaining a legal decree, 
aided by the forged data, for themselves or their association. "From antique sources, surely, 
no legal claims can be inferred." (FUETER) So, the forgeries of the humanists did not aim at 
practical-actual purposes, they much rather sport a timeless character and spring equally from 
immaterialistic, if not to say: "idealistic", motives. One could thus be tempted to assume that 


it was an embarrassing thought to a man such as ANNIUS OF VITERBO, as a scholar with an 


217 


interest in history, that the light of historical research was unable to drive away the dark 
hovering above the old history of most European countries. Out of a ‘horror vacui', he was 
thus driven to cultivate the neglected places of the old tradition with his falsifications, and he 
has thus satisfied a restless scientific yearning via a purely /earned history falsification. This 
assumption however can, as sufficient explanatory reason of the humanist "tendency" to 
history correction, not at all satisfy. ANNIUS OF VITERBO, too, would not have dreamed of 
following his pseudo-historical drive to create, from a pure fancy for learned phantasies. 
Nobody likes to unnecessarily offer a weak spot, and ANNIUS had to account for the 
possibility that at any day, a genuine antique source could come to light in some archive, and 
that it would immediately show his forgeries up as such. And yet, ANNIUS OF VITERBO acted 
so, as if he knew exactly that antique sources which could refer to the subject of his forgeries 
did not exist!! During the course of the investigation, we will reveal the real basic motives of 
the forgeries of the humanists; the papal 'magister sacri palatii’, too, was a colleague, an 
associate, of the planfully run universal forgery action by the late medieval church. With 
interest, we note that research has declared the falsifications of an ANNIUS OF VITERBO — and 
as we will hear momentarily, also the numerous other humanist history fabrications, to be 
learned forgeries, and cannot declare them to be anything else, either. So, expert science, too, 


for the humanist period, operates with the term "learned" history falsification. 


However, what actually is meant by "learned" forgery? And how do things get to a 
learned history falsification? A MEISTER™ lists the following motives for the "learned fraud": 
"Discoverers' vanity, in order to strut new sources — misguided collectors' frenzy, in order to 
brag with invented letters of significant personalities — obsession of proving a scientific 
assumption with documents — intention to establish an as high as possible old age of a family 
or a place." Historical science has now, as initially mentioned, established cases of learned 


fraudulence in the historical realm particularly frequently for the period of the Renaissance 


218 


and humanism, yes, almost all falsifications of this era have shown themselves to the 
researchers to be "learned" mystifications. It is remarkable that, for the early medieval 
centuries, learned forgeries have virtually not at all been established. Why, critique assumes, 
as we know, with all documental forgeries in the Middle Ages, practical-material motives of 
the on personal (associative) advantages focused forgers to be in effect. The information of 
HOLDER-EGGER, that as early as 1230, a certain CODAGNELLUS, has staged a "learned" 
historical fraud with a forged chronicle, must thus cause a little surprise, and that all the 
more, when one hears that, according to HOLDER-EGGER, the "fancy to fable" has driven the 
Italian CODAGNELLUS to his fake work. "By these stories (of CODAGNELLUS)", says named 
historian, "the Italians' enormous fancy to fable is being illustrated in a very peculiar 
manner." But then, just what, we ask, may have ultimately inspired CODAGNELLUS to pass 
off his fabulations as historical truth, of all things? Did the alleged author of the 13th century 
want to strut new sources from discoverers' vanity? Did he want to prove scientific 
assumptions? Did he want to establish an as high as possible old age for a family or a place? 
None of these, says HOLDER-EGGER, from pure fancy to fable did the author forge his 
historical phantasy pieces! We think differently about the CODAGNELLUS case and reckon 
that there must have been some purpose standing in the background. Italians! Fancy to fable 
"historically"! One pricks up their ears. One remembers "that in the humanist direction, there 
lay the tendency, at times, to grant too much power to the imagination, and to fill gaps in the 
historical tradition with arbitrary fictionalisations."°? CODAGNELLUS would gloriously fit the 
long line of humanist history forgers — we've long known that his fabrication cannot have 
been produced in the 13th century, but that it has emerged from the to us so well-known 


universal workshop. 


"Italy may pride itself having initiated, next to humanist historiography, humanist 


source falsification, too." This fact no longer surprises us at all. He who has wandered the 


219 


long examination path with me up to here, has long been able to expect such finding with 
certainty. The general result of all previous critical examinations of the written tradition 
is the untouchable fact of a universal history invention action by the overall church 
under the leadership of Rome having happened on the verge of modern times. 
Renaissance and humanism are a symptom, a collateral phenomenon of the action initiated by 
ROME, therefore, the "humanist tendency to fable" is not an individual weakness of certain 
authors, but this "tendency" is the general expression of the driving idea of the Renaissance- 


humanism movement. 


I carry on further discussing the question of the point in time of the enterprise by 
selected fruits and results of the action. With the following forgery series from the 
Renaissance period, for the first time, an archaeological topic is being touched. Why, has the 
forgery association, one will ask surprised, practised their history improvement occupation 
also in the archaeological field? Here, for now, just the bare claim: indeed, the universal 
history falsification does include archaeological forgeries. The humanist falsification which is 
up next, is preserved for us in the so-called "CONSTANTINIAN AREA DESCRIPTION" which is 
supposed to represent an index of the most important buildings and monuments of the old 
city of Rome, sorted by 14 areas. Now, this forgery delivers the highly interesting result that 
the learned history forgers, too, knew how to handle the tactics of double-entry book-keeping 
equally skilfully or equally clumsily, respectively, as their medieval colleagues. Yes, we gain 
the lively impression as if the humanists sat at the same forger's bench with their colleagues 


from, for example, the 10th century. 


The mentioned AREA DESCRIPTION has descended upon us in two versions: 1. Usually 
called 'NOTITIA', 2. the CURIOSUM URBIS ROMAE. In the HANDBUCH DER KLASSISCHEN 
ALTERTUMSWISSENSCHAFT™ (SCIENCE OF THE CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY HANDBOOK), we find out 


the following about the noteworthy fate that this "antique" work experienced during the 


220 


Renaissance: "Since the end of the 15th century, the AREA DESCRIPTION appears in 
completely interpolated (made unauthentic by small insertions) form. Originator of the 
interpolated text is POMPONIOUS LAETUS, from whom all the while, nothing lay further (sic!) 
than committing a forgery with it. Still today, in the Codex Vatic. 3394 and the Cod. Marc. 
Lat. X n. 195, we possess his edition (!) of the AREAs; one notices, how during the course of 
his studies, and prompted by new script findings, he entered topographical notes, an 
occupation which was continued by his students. The deception began only when JANUS 
PARRHASIUS (1503 or 1504) published this interpolated text under the name of a not at all 
existing (!) antique writer, the PUBLIUS VIKTOR. FLAVIO BIONDO (around 1540) was the first 
who made a connection (erroneously) between the name of SEX. RUFUS and the CURIOSUM; 
he found the latter in a script of the MONTE CASSINO behind the BREVARIUM of SEX. RUFUS, 
and declared him, in his ROMA INSTAURATA I, 18, to be the so far unknown author of it [the 
BREVARIUM. Both of these authors, plucked from thin air, have then been published by 
PANVINIUS in new, interpolated form. In this form, they have, up and into our century, 
possessed such authority, that the original AREA DESCRIPTION was considered an excerpt from 


them." 


I am finding: four Renaissance writers display an amazing eagerness in consecutively 
disfiguring "antique" works to the point of being indiscernible by interpolations, and in 
smuggling the thus created fabrications into the scientific market under the flag of 
fictionalised old authors. Indeed, nothing lay further from P LAETUS and his students than to 
commit a forgery with their interpolations, supposedly; one is to ask however, then what in 


wo 


the world could have inspired these men to "improve" and "complete" "antique" writings? 
And that, in two "versions"? According to J BURCHHARDT”’, supposedly, "nobody" has 
"treated texts as carefully and shyly" as P LAETUS, which is however at odds with what H 


JORDAN” lists as an example for the treatment by LAETUS with regards to the antique AREA 


221 


DESCRIPTION: "The genuine texts of the CURIOSUM and the NOTITIA have 'templum Solis et 
castra, porticum Gypsiani et Constantini'. These, in the areas of LAETUS, turned into: 
‘templum Solis, castra Gentiana, porticus Constantini'; in the (false) VIKTOR: 'templum Solis, 
casta Gentiana aliter Gipsiana'." Such reprimand of a "genuine" author by P LAETUS gives us 
a start and increases our suspicion of the "carefulness" and "shyness" of the head of the well- 
known "ROMAN Academy", when we hear about LAETUS by L Geiger®’that "he cannot be 
quite acquitted of the allegation having, at times, forged coins and scripts from overly great 
love for antiquity (sic!)." With PARRHASIUS, BIONDO and PANVINIUS, the intent to forge is 
not being denied; of the latter, JORDAN (l.c., p 309) explicitly declares that, "in his RUFUS, he 
wildly invents away in parts". That blind chance should have consecutively lead the named 
sirs to the same subject, is ruled out, because the "editors", taking over from each other, 
acted obviously according to a certain plot! Subjective motives could not have triggered 
ongoingly attaching "corrections" to the named thing, the forgers much rather acted under an 
objective coercion that followed from the nature of the works; namely, the allegedly antique 
AREA DESCRIPTION is in both preserved versions a humanist forgery, that is, this written 
forgery runs parallel with certain monumental forgeries! The AREA DESCRIPTION in its 
overall tradition shows the characteristic attributes of all so far discussed forgeries, it may 
suffice for this, to once again name the text example from the previous page given by 
JORDAN, with regards to the exercised veiling tactics (1. the "genuine" text, 2. LAETUS' text, 
3. VICTOR's text). The "genuine, old" AREA DESCRIPTION, in truth represents the /ast stage of 


the humanist forgery, is the final result of the topographic mystifications. 


In Germany, the "fame", having cast great humanist forgeries in the realm of the 
literary tradition, is attached to the name of JOHANNES TRITHEMIUS (or TRITHEIM). TRITHEIM 
(1462-1518) was abbot of the SPONHEIM monastery, later head of the Scot's monastery to ST 


JOHN in WURZBURG. L GEIGER® reports the following about this noteworthy man to us: "He, 


222 


the pious theologist, who stormed with inexorable intensity against the moral damages of the 
monastery and secular clerics, a strict catholic, has earned himself significant fame as a 
history forger. TRITHEIM is no history writer who only seeks the truth, but he desires the 
proof for his favourite ideas, regardless of whether they conform with the truth. This 
tendency has directly prompted him to forge. In order to prove a scientific flower of the 
monastery HIRSCHAU, in order to prove the old connection of the latter with FULDA, he 
invents the FULDA chronicler MEGINFRIED who supposedly died around 1010; in order to 
make the old fairy tale of the TROJAN provenance of the FRANCS believable, and in order to 
prove fabulous deeds of the FRANCS during the first christian centuries, he invents the history 
writer HUNIBALD, who has supposedly, living during the times of King CHLODWIG, and 
drawing from old lost sources, described the history of the FRANCONIAN Empire during the 
oldest times. MEGINFRIED and HUNIBALD are only creations of the TRITHEIM imagination. 
Nobody apart from him has ever seen their hand-writing. In WURZBURG, he informs on the 
HUNIBALD codex which supposedly was in SPONHEIM, he gives miserably sufficient 
information to Emperor MAXIMILIAN, who is most interested in getting to know such an 
honourable witness of old German glory. In all this, the fraud is so clumsy (!!) that TRITHEIM 
himself has thought it necessary to distance himself by certain idioms, so, that the hand- 
writing would be difficult to read, perhaps be interpolated, and he was so easy (!) to unveil, 
that even in that uncritical (sic!) era, quite a few (!!), e.g. HERMANN OF NEUENAAR, 
discovered the fraud. This TRITHEMIUS, the one thus exposed as a charlatan and fraudster, is a 


fundamentally educated man, an all-round scholar of amazing versatility." 


The TRITHEIM case is worth some thought. A pious theologist, who is dead serious 
about the teachings of Christianity, has no conscience troubling him in working on historical 
fraudulence of unforeseeable implications. A pious christian who simultaneously is a hard- 


boiled fraudster?! We rub our chin in doubt, we feel as if we'd just seen water and fire getting

married! SILBERNAGEL” is struggling in vain to find a key to understanding the mystery. He 
reckons, TRITHEIM "understands the word 'truth' not in the purely objective, but in a certain 
subjective sense.”" That is truth, that piously serves religion and the church, and serves for 
edification. That is the tendency of his history writing." These are excuses which TRITHEIM 
himself shames, because, as WEGELE” tells, TRITHEIM knows full well and says it himself, 
"that the christian belief as well as the vow as a monk enjoin on him the love of truth and the 
hatred of the lie..." "Because the lips that lie kill the soul." "The author who mixes truth with 
lies, throws history into confusion." Who speaks thus, has the objective truth in mind, at any 
rate, wants to make the world believe that what he had written down as historical truth to be 
objective truth, and if TRITHEIM explicitly protests®' that he would tell only true things, only 
write the truth, he doubtlessly has his eye on the objective truth, since he of course gives his 


allegedly "edifying observation" a strictly scientific appearance. 


Yet, we notice some mysterious streaks in the WURZBURG abbot. How could this 
"fundamentally educated" man have talked himself into believing he could pull wool over the 
world's eyes with such a "clumsy fraud"? Why, his mystification was "so easy to unveil", that 
it, in a manner of speaking, has been called out at birth as the cuckoo's egg it was! And the 
least intelligible: TRITHEIM had many learned friends, he belonged to a circle of humanists, 
whose members were joined with the learned Rhine sodality by a CONRAD CELTES in the 
year 1491, and who, among each other, corresponded in the by Tritheim invented secret code 
—none of the friends whom Tritheim must surely have told about his discovery of HUNIBALD 
first, has warned him and pointed out the inauthenticity of the fabrication!! Or should 
TRITHEIM's friends, of all people, have been such blockheads not to recognise the "so easily 
unveiled" mystification? We however, need no longer rack our brains, because we already 
have the leading thread in our hand. TRITHEIM was unfortunate: his HUNIBALD was a botched 


VII Of course, only folks like 'Silbernagel' (engl. 'Silvernail') can even conceive a concept of 'objective' and 
"subjective truth’.

forgery, as was the CONSTANTINIAN donation document, 1.e. it turned out during the universal 
history invention enterprise that the entire TROJAN provenance prose had to be dropped, and, 
out of necessity, possibly again erased from the historical novel — an operation that cost 
TRITHEIM, the specialist on the TROJAN subject, his neck. TRITHEIM, an associate of the great 
enterprise! Here lies the solution of the many riddles that the case TRITHEIM has brought 
upon historical research. The pious theologist was able to calm his conscience, because he 
worked, like hundreds and hundreds of his clerical associates, for an "idea". Of course, he did 
not aspire to obtaining personal advantages of some kind, he had no kind of subjective motif 
prompting him to his deed, but, as an "unselfish" worker, he laboured on a work which was 
meant to serve the entire catholic church: during the course of the fictionalised history novel, 
to illustrate the lawful work of divine justice. The lofty super-individual ends justify my 
means — TRITHEIM was able to calmingly and excusingly tell himself, and to dull the point of 
the nagging sting of fraud — because he knew that his doings per se were fraud and 


abominable. 


Now, we have to turn our eyes away from the humanist forgers again, and towards the 
overall mass of the so far discussed medieval forgeries. In every individual case, proof has 
been established that all the already by research discovered, then by us newly unearthed, 
forgeries do not represent "practical", but "learned" machinations. However, these 
diplomatical and literary fake pieces from the Middle Ages cannot possibly be regarded as 
isolated, in the most varying medieval centuries independently from each other manufactured 
learned fabrications. Much rather, all falsifications stem from one workshop, are the result of 
one big action. For us, proof followed from the time and again gained realisation of the 
identical make-up of the examined pieces, from the equally time and again established 
absolutely equal and absolutely impossible psychology of the scribes standing behind the 


pieces, furthermore, from the peculiar workings of "chance" with regards to the loss of almost 


225 


all originals and "shared model sources", as well as finally the existence of the forged papal 
registries in connection with the comprehensive lack of secular registries and archives. Equal 
kind of psychology (in the sense of epidemic retardedness), equal kind of make-up, loss of 
almost all original pieces and the lack of secular registries — become only explainable by the 
assumption of the planful action of a purposefully striving and organisationally tightly 
connected forgery association. And this association possessed, as we have recognised, in 


the ROMAN curia their head, their headquarters. 


Now, the question when the forgers have been at work, easily finds its answer through 
the following consideration: the action could not perhaps have been going on in the 8th, 10th 
or 12th century! If one wanted to place the enterprise in those early centuries, one would be 
forced to trace the great mass of falsifications from the 13th, 14th and 15th century back to a 
later, second action. However, this assumption of a later second action is now being 
abandoned as anti-sensical and impossible by the fact that all the later falsifications, by their 
make-up, by the psychology of the scribes etc., show quite the same trademark as the earlier 
fake pieces. Only one single universal history falsification action can have happened, and 
this action has to be temporally placed at the end of the Middle Ages. Two circumstances 
define this temporal fixation: firstly, that temporally, the pseudo-historical sources of history, 
manufactured by the same fabrication system, reach up to the threshold of modern times (and 
with "latecomers", even beyond), and secondly, that especially in this period, the great flood 
of humanist history falsification rises. These phenomena imply each other, that means that 
the universal history falsification action parades in the mask of the spiritual movement that 
we have given the name humanism (Renaissance). Both movements are one! The 
Renaissance is not only a re-birth of antiquity, but also the new birth of the Middle 


Ages. 


226 


A fourth Book will bring editions, additions and explanations. The universal history 
falsification action will be, by evidence from the medieval /egal history, by proving the 
falsification of ROMAN sources as well (TACITUS!), by furthermore revealing the artificiality 


of medieval writing development, lit up from different viewpoints and confirmed.
