PREFACE 


Von Sybel, writing in i88i, expressed his pleasure in 
the acceptance by scholars of that scientific recon- 
struction of the history of the First Crusade which he 
had given to the world forty years earlier, and his hope 
that in the course of another forty years the results of 
his researches would have penetrated into text-books 
and school-books.^ 

That hope is now in process of fulfilment, but the 
great Chronicles of the Crusades are still only accessible 
in scholarly editions which are too costly, too cumbrous, 
and too elaborate for the ordinary reader. 

This small edition of the ‘ primary authority ’ ® for 
the history of the First Crusade, the anonymous 
Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolymitanorum, is 
specially designed for the use of students reading for the 
PreUminary Examination in Modern History in the 
University of Oxford, but it is hoped that it may help 
to guide the feet of other pilgrims on the ‘ Way of 
the Holy Sepulchre’, the iter Hierosolymitanum, for 
the little book forms an excellent starting-point for the 
study of the Crusading movement, and deserves to be 
more widely known. Of the three existing editions 
of the Gesta Francorum, one is included in Bongars' 
Gesta Dei per Francos, published at Hanover in i6ii ;

another appeared in 1866 in the third volume of the 
magnificent but bulky Recueil des Hisioriens des 
CroisadeSy Hisioriens occidentaux, published by the Paris 
Academie des Inscriptions. The third and most recent, 
Heinrich Hagenmeyer’s admirable and comparatively 
handy edition, Anonymi Gesta Francorum et aliorum 
Hierosolymitanoruniy Heidelberg, 1890, is bewildering 
from the very completeness of its critical apparatus y its 
wealth of prefaces, notes, and variant readings. The 
present edition simply aims at producing a text -'book 
which may serve as an introduction to the more learned 
works on the subject. Bongars’ text has been followed 
in spelling and in the usage, characteristic of the date 
of publication, of printing u and v as v initially and 
as u in other positions in small letters, and uniformly 
as V in capitals. Punctuation has been modernized, 
italics have been replaced by Roman type throughout, 
and small letters have in some cases been substituted 
for capitals. 

My grateful thanks are due to the Master and 
Fellows of Gonville and Caius College and to the 
officers of the University Library, Cambridge, for 
facilitating my collation of MS. C., to Miss C. M. Ady 
for kind assistance in proof-reading, and to Mr. W. H. 
Stevenson for valuable suggestions and corrections. 

The late Master of Balliol encouraged me to edit 
this book, which he first taught me to know. To his 
memory I inscribe it.

INTRODUCTION 

MANUSCRIPTS AND TEXT 

The mss. used by Hagenmeyer in his edition of the Gesta 
Francorum were classified by him in three groups. In the 
first group, BG, he placed B, a Madrid MS. of the early four- 
teenth century, and G, Bongars' printed edition, which rests 
on two unidentified MSS. These two sources he regarded as 
probably nearest to the original text, since they are dis- 
tinguished by the crudity and awkwardness of their style 
and by their agreement with early plagiarists. He therefore 
based his own text on them wherever they agreed. When 
they differed, he gave the preference as a rule to the reading 
which most closely coincided with the text of the early 
plagiarists of the Gesfa, especially Tudebod, who probably 
had access to the original manuscript. He gave the variant 
readings of all the other known MSS. except F, which is 
late and much abbreviated, and also the readings of R, 
the Recueil edition.^ The Recueil edition prints the Gesta 
Francorum under the title of Tudebodus ahhreviatus,^ It 
is based mainly on a twelfth-century Vatican MS., B, and 
on Bongars, with variants also from B, the one MS. not used 
by Hagenmeyer. MS. E is placed by Hagenmeyer in his 
second group BB, both Vatican MSS. of the twelfth century. 
In both there is a serious hiatus in the text (see foot-note, 
c. xxiii, 23), which also occurs in H, a MS. of the third group. 

This third group, ACH, includes a twelfth- century MS., 
A, a MS. H, which seems to have once been at Kenilworth,

and the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century MS. C, which is 
now in the library of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 
The remaining MS. F is also a Cambridge MS. now at 
Corpus Christi College. It dates from the fourteenth 
century. The present edition is based on Bongars’ text, 
with emendations from the MSS. and Tudebod, and 
with variant readings from representative MSS. of Hagen- 
meyer’s three groups. B represents Group I, E Group II, 
and C Group III. The editions of Hagenmeyer and the 
Recueil have been carefully compared with Bongars 
for B and E variants, and Hagenmeyer’s collation of E 
has occasionally been altered in accordance with the 
Recueil. C has been re-collated from the original MS. 
Limitations of space have made it necessary to omit from 
the foot-notes such minor differences between the MSS. 
as variations in spelling, transpositions of words, and un- 
important changes in grammatical construction. Where the 
path is so well worn it is impossible to avoid treading in the 
footsteps of those who have gone before, and it would be 
absurd to sacrifice accuracy on the shrine of originality ; yet 
in a few cases the readings of the most recent and thorough 
editor, Hagenmeyer, have been rejected, though the reasons 
for such rejection have been fully given in the notes. 

One possible source of error, perhaps of enlightenment, 
Hagenmeyer hardly notices. Bongars’ printed folio edition 
of i6ii bears evidence of respect for the letter of his MS. 
sources, but it also suggests that he had some difficulty in 
reading them, or that their text was corrupt. Thus, while 
on p. 17 a lacuna is carefully marked by asterisks, on p. 58. 
occurs the obviously erroneous form Hugo CU Forcenez. 
These points are noted as they appear in the text, as they 
have a definite critical value. In MSS. BE of the Gesta 
FrdncoYUfn and in the printed editions of Bongars and the 
Recueil, the material is divided into four books of very

unequal length. If, as Hagenmeyer thinks is not impro- 
bable, the author himself is responsible for this arrange- 
ment, he probably failed to carry it beyond the ninth 
chapter. As, however, it was repeated by Bongars, it has 
been retained in this edition. 

The four books are further subdivided into eight sections, 
each of which ends with a doxology and Amen, in the 
following sequence :

Each section marks a stage in the military history of the 
Crusade and closes with a military event, beginning with 
the battle on the Vardar and ending with the battle of 
Ascalon. Paulin Paris ^ suggested that these sections were 
of the nature of letters or " wax bulletins which would be 
sent to Europe, copied, and read for edification in the 
churches of the West, and afterwards worked up, with 
additional notes, into a book. Hagenmeyer ^ is more con- 
vincing when he treats the Gesta as a diary or journal, 
written in sections during intervals of leisure in the course of 
the war, while the events recorded were still fresh in the 
writer's memory.

was 'to see the Universities, and search our Libraries'. 
In i6ii he published two folio volumes of records of the 
Crusades, under the title of Gesia Dei per Francos, sive 
orientalium expeditionum et regni Francorum Hierosoly- 
mitani historia. In 1612 he died, leaving his work unfinished. 
To Bongars' search in English libraries and to his friendship 
with Camden we probably owe one of the two MSS. on which 
he based the earliest printed edition of the anonymous 
Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolymitanorum, with which 
the Gesta Dei per Francos opens, for one of those MSS. was 
given to him by Camden, the other by the French savant, 
Paul Petau. Bongars regarded the Gesta Francorum as an 
original source, the work of an Italian follower of Bohe- 
mund, and until 1641 this was the received opinion. In that 
year, in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Historiae Fran- 
corum Scriptores coaetanei, appeared Besly's edition of the 
Historia de Hierosolymifano Itinere of Petrus Tudebodus, 
Pierre Tudeboeui, Tudebode, or Tudebod, a French priest of 
Civray in Poitou. In his learned preface Besly maintained 
that Tudebod was the original authority, from whom the 
anonymous author of the Gesta had borrowed most of his 
material without acknowledgement. Besly 's view was 
almost universally accepted, and held the field for about 
two centuries. Von Ranke was the first to throw doubt on 
it, while in 1841 von Sybel, in his epoch-making Geschichte 
des ersten Kreuzzuges, followed by the investigations of his 
pupil Gurewitsch,^ reversed the decision of Besly, relegated 
Tudebod to the rank of a plagiarist, and restored the 
Anonymous to his pride of place as an original authority 
of the first importance. About the same time (1842) a 
Frenchman, de Saulcy,^ arrived independently at much the 
same results. Though the editors of the Recueil des

THE BOOK ANI> ITS AUTHOR xi 

Historiens des Croisades (1866) still clung to the old opinion 
and called the work Tudebodus abbreviatus} they were in the 
minority. Von SybeFs conclusions won general acceptance, 
and were fully borne out by Hagenmeyer's critical edition 
of the text, which was published in i8go. 

Besly's argument for the priority of Tudebod rested 
mainly on certain passages in which Tudebod speaks of 
himself as an eyewitness, and as a writer, gives his name, 
and mentions his brother, 2 who died on the Crusade. 
These passages are not found in the Gesta, and Besly 
accused the anonymous author of deliberately suppressing 
them. Von Sybel's counter-argument, which is well 
summarized by Hagenmeyer, showed that the passages in 
question were interpolations, and urged the priority of the 
Anonymous on four main grounds : (i) he uses the first 
person throughout : Tudebod uses both the first and the 
third person ; (ii) the Anonymous was a soldier, and writes 
consistently in this character : Tudebod was a priest, and 
writes sometimes as an ecclesiastic, sometimes, following the 
Anonymous, as a layman ; (iii) Tudebod's additions to the 
Gesta are anecdotic and personal, and could be easily inter- 
polated, while his omissions of passages which occur in the 
Gesta are awkward and clumsy and interfere with the text ; 
(iv) Tudebod has used not only the Gesta, but the work 
of Raymond of Agiles, whereas the Anonymous has not 
incorporated a single passage from Raymond, though 
Hagenmeyer believes that both Raymond and his contem- 
porary Fulcher of Chartres have borrowed from the Gesta. 

The Gesta Francorum, then, the short, simply written 
record of an unknown soldier-pilgrim, is now recognized as 
one of the main sources from which the medieval historians

of the First Crusade drew their inspiration, a source whence 
the stream of Crusading literature began to flow even before 
the First Crusade was at an end. 

Among the direct plagiarists who copied the Geda 
almost word for word, without acknowledgment of their 
debt, are Tudebod and, in a less degree, the anonymous 
twelfth- century Historia belli sacri. ^ In the reaction in 
favour of the Gesta, the real value of these authorities is in 
danger of being forgotten. Tudebod was, fairly certainly, 
himself an eyewitness of the First Crusade, and his additions 
to the text of the Gesta reflect his own experience. If he 
plagiarizes, he is the earliest of the plagiarists, and he may 
represent the original text better than some of the later 
copyists, who thought to improve the rude style of the 
Anonymous. The Historia belli sacri, too, which Mabillon ^ 
actually regarded as the source of Tudebod and of the 
Gesta, may often serve to establish a reading, or to clear up a 
textual difficulty. More subtle in their method of imitation 
are the writers of the first three decades of the twelfth cen- 
tury who mention the Gesta as their authority, but take 
credit to themselves for embellishing and elaborating the 
crude raw material with which they deal. Baudri, Arch- 
bishop of Dol, Guibert, Abbot of Nogent-sur-Seine, and 
Robert, the Monk of Rheims,^ all speak of the little anony- 
mous book, with its rustic style, libellum . . . niniis rustica- 
num,^ on which their own more polished work is based. 

The influence of the Gesta Francorum can also be traced, 
though in a more indirect form, in the writings of such 
imitators and occasional borrowers as Raymond of Agiles,

THE BOOK AND ITS AUTHOR xiii 

Fulcher of Chartres, Ekkehard of Aura, who in iioi read 
at Jerusalem a little book on the Crusade, which may have 
been a copy of the Gesta^ and the versifiers Fulco and 
Gilo of Paris.^ Even the romantic and legendary sources, 
the Chanson d'Antioche and the romance of Godfrey de 
Bouillon, probably owe something to the camp gossip and 
the marvellous tales preserved in this unpretending con- 
temporary record, and thus it has passed into the pictur- 
esque pages of Albert of Aix, and has set its mark on the 
great Crusading history of William of Tyre. 

If the author of the Gesta must remain anonymous, he 
has at least unconsciously revealed himself in all but name 
in his book, and from that book Bongars, von Sybel, and 
Hagenmeyer have reconstructed his personality with 
scholarly care and insight. There can be no doubt that he 
was a layman and a soldier, presumably of gentle birth, 
since he served as a knight till poverty and misfortune 
reduced him to the ranks of the fedites? He was, in all 
probability, a southern Italian of Norman stock, for 
whom the practical and immediate knowledge of the 
Crusade began in connexion with Bohemund’s division of 
the Crusading host, to whom Bohemund, that most 
valiant warrior, wise and prudent, dignified and honour- 
able, strong and unconquered, is the ideal leader, honor 
et decus totuis ntundi, bellorum arbiter et certaminum index, 
athleta Christi, and, for the anonymous chronicler himself,

dominus, the feudal lord/ of whose famulatiis, or personal 
following, he seems to have formed part.^ The cry of 
Deus vuU, which the French Crusaders first heard at 
Clermont, echoes for the Italian-Norman as Deus le volt, 
from the siege of Amalfi ; the crosses that his comrades 
wear are cut from the splendid cloak of his hero Bohe- 
mund ® The names of the petty princes of southern Italy 
are familiar to him, though he only knows the more im- 
portant leaders of the northern French army> He uses 
Italian-Latin constructions and words, such as piscina, 
tenda, menda, and places the conquest of his modest 
home-land Apulia among the objects of ambition of the 
powerful Eastern prince Kerboga,^ while he shows a more 
intimate acquaintance with both Byzantine and Saracen 
affairs than would be likely to be possessed by a French- 
man or even by a North Italiari. To judge from his use of 
the first person and from the vividness of his descriptions 
of particular incidents, he took the cross at Amalfi in the 
summer of 1096, and crossed over to the Balkan Peninsula 
with the South Italian division later in the same year. He 
was present at the battle of the Vardar, encamped under 
Tancred’s command outside Constantinople during the 
negotiations of the Crusading leaders with the Emperor 
Alexius, crossed the Bosphorus in the spring of 1097, 
went through the siege of Nicaea and the battle of Dory- 
laeum, and before the end of October 1097 had settled down 
to the siege of Antioch, in Bohemund's camp, to the east of 
the city.® He took part in the plunder-raid of Bohemund 
and Robert of Flanders in the last days of 1097 ; he helped 
to build the fort opposite the Bridge Gate in March 1098 
and was in the fight of the 6th of March, when the Crusaders

drove the Turks over the bridge and defeated them with 
great slaughter When in June 1098 the city was betrayed 
by Firouz, as one of the chosen band of Bohemund's men 
who made the first attack, he was among those who 
entered Antioch by a postern gate.^ When the Christians 
in Antioch were in turn besieged by the Turks he fought 
against Kerboga's army in the battle of June the loth, and 
worked at the wall which was to protect Bohemund’s forces 
from the Turks who held the citadel. He was present in the 
church of St. Peter when the Holy Lance was found, and 
on June 28, 1098, in the final battle with Kerboga, he fought 
on horseback, pursued the flying Turks, and shared the 
rejoicings over the victory.® It was probably now that 
he wrote that graphic account of the siege which fills 
eighteen of the thirty-nine chapters into which his book is 
divided. In the late November of 1098 he accompanied 
Bohemund to Marra, but after the siege and capture of the 
town, instead of returning with his lord to Antioch, he 
seems to have joined the Proven9al army and to have gone 
on to Jerusalem with the followers of Count Raymond of 
Toulouse. With them he experienced the siege of Area and 
the journey by the coast-towns to the Holy City. Here he 
fought, both in the attack on June 13, 1099, 
successful assault on June 15, when Jerusalem was taken 
by the Crusaders, The book ends with a lively description 
of the battle of Ascalon on August 12, 1099, and of the 
triumphant return to Jerusalem of the booty-laden Franks.^ 
The author of the Gesta was thus admirably fitted by 
position and experience to be a chronicler of the great 
expedition in which he played so active a part. As a knight, 
enjoying the privileges of the knightly status, he would

learn something of the policy of the leaders in their divided 
counsels. As a foot-soldier, during the later months of the 
Crusade, he knew the suferings and the courage of the 
pauperes homines pedites. As a layman he stands out con- 
spicuously in the crowd of ecclesiastical chroniclers. Pre- 
judices he may have, but they are of another kind from 
those of the emotional ProvenQal priest, Raymond of 
Agiles,^ or the didactic royal chaplain, Fulcher of Chartres. 
No less well was he fitted for his task by his nature and 
character, A thorough soldier, he has all the military virtues 
— ^loyalty, steadfast resolution, personal bravery, scorn 
of cowardice, and admiration of skill and courage in others, 
even in his enemies the Turks, hellorum ingeniosissimi,^ 
In recalling the stress of battle his unimpassioned style can 
kindle into eloquence.® He is keenly interested in military 
operations and in the art of war, and is a first-rate authority 
for the strategy and tactics of the First Crusade.^ With the 
Norman adaptability and spirit of adventure he combines 
Norman shrewdness and common sense. He is practical, 
observant, fair-minded, sagacious. Yet he is full of the 
simple, somewhat credulous religious faith of his time and 
surroundings, that faith which had brought Norman Italy 
into peculiarly close relations with the Papal See. If he 
does not see visions himself, he gives credence to the visions 
of others ; he accepts the genuineness of the Holy Lance 
without hesitation ; he believes in the appearance of the 
soldier-saints and their spirit-armies at the battle of Antioch, 
because ' several of our men saw these things His book is

thing more ; it is a record of the great deeds wrought by- 
God through the Crusaders ; it has a unity of purpose and 
a certain epic dignity, quite apart from the personality of its 
author. This the author feels. If he uses the first person, 
it is always the first person plural, not the ' editorial we 
but the symbol of the body corporate. He sinks the 
individual in the cause ; he tastes the joy of a common 
interest and of organized common action. Above all, he is 
in touch with reality. ‘ He writes his Latin says Hagen- 
meyer,^ ‘ just as he was accustomed to think in his Italian- 
Norman idiom.' It is this honest provincialism, which the 
later polite editors condemned as rusticity, which makes his 
work precious . He describes in simple language what he sees, 
not what other people expect him to see, and therefore ' he 
being dead yet speaketh \

impulses and passions, religious sentiment, the fighting 
instinct, romance and the lure of the unknown, the love of 
adventure and the hope of gain. So many-sided a pheno- 
menon has been attributed to many causes, but probably 
the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum touched the 
heart of the matter when he wrote of the motto valida, the 
wave of unrest which was passing through Western society 
at the time appointed by God.^ About the same date 
another anonymous chronicler in remote England, in writing 
of the Crusade, used much the same words : ‘ In this year 
there was a mighty stirring {my cel sfyrung) of the people and 
of the peoples of other lands also/ ^ There can be little 
doubt that the First Crusade was in the main a religious 
movement which owed the force of its impetus to the 
peculiar conditions of the age, and was in itself only one 
manifestation of the general quickening and awakening, 
economic, political, social, religious, and intellectual, of a 
century which had known the fret and strain, the ' mighty 
stirring ' of revival and reform, alike in Church and in 
State. Behind the First Crusade lay many new interests and 
activities : the growth of towns and commerce, the expansion 
of the Norman race, the development of monasticism and of 
asceticism, of missions and of organized pilgrimage ; the 
investiture struggle, also, with the controversial literature to 
which it gave birth ; and, it must always be remembered, 
the constant menace of the Turkish advance in Asia. 
In 1071 the Turks occupied Jerusalem, and the fatal 
battle of Manzikert, following on the Seljuk conquest 
of Armenia, broke down the feeble defences of the Byzan- 
tine Empire. By 1078 Jerusalem was in the hands of 
the Seljuks, while in 1084 Antioch, one of the patriarchates 
of the Greek Church, was lost to Christianity. Constanti- 
nople was seriously threatened by the Seljuk Sultan of

THE FIRST CRUSADE 

Rum or Iconium when the great conqueror Malik Shah died 
in 1092, and internal quarrels weakened the power of his 
successors.^ But the danger was still acute. Fulcher of 
Chartres, who was present at the Council of Clermont, 
mentions the occupation of the Christian provinces of 
Rum {Romania) by the Turks as one of the reasons for the 
Pope’s crossing the Alps into France in 1095. Urban II 
seems, too, to have laid special stress in his Crusading speech 
on the importance of helping the Eastern Christians to 
check the tide of Turkish conquest, which had reached the 
Bosphorus.^ Piety and Policy ® went hand in hand in this 
high enterprise. 

It is often said that the Crusades were but part of the 
ceaseless struggle between East and West, taking a religious 
form in an age of world-religions ^ and a military form in an 
age of militarism and of fighting faiths. There had been 
peaceful pilgrimages to the Holy Land and religious wars 
against infidel Moors in Spain and Arabs in Sicily before the 
First Crusade united the pilgrimage motive with Christian 
militancy. Later romance not only set Charlemagne and 
his paladins to fight the Mohammedans of Spain, but sent 
them on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem “ without shields or 
lances or sharp swords.” ® The Crusaders trod the ' road of

INTRODUCTION 


Charles the Great ' ^ more truly than they knew. They were 
not merely pilgrims, peregrini, but ‘ the pilgrim knights of 
Christ Christi milites peregrini? 

The maj ority of the Western chroniclers of the eleventh 
century, the actual eyewitnesses of the First Crusade, saw in 
it the fulfilment of prophecy, the work of God, acting through 
the Church and the Pope, the Head and Father of the 
Church. Later writers magnified the personal responsibility 
for the initiative of the Holy War. The Chanson des chetifs 
and the Chanson d'Antioche, the Historia belli sacri, Albert of 
Aix, and William of Tyre, with the modern historians who 
relied mainly on these authorities, made Peter the Hermit 
the forerunner of Urban II, and the author and instigator 
of the Crusade. In the narratives of the eyewitnesses of the 
movement he falls into his proper place as a successful and 
eloquent preacher and recruiting agent, and a leader of the 
ill-fated ' Peasants ' Crusade ' of 1096. After the establish- 
ment of the House of Boulogne on the throne of Jerusalem, 
Godfrey of Bouillon became a hero of romance, the pio 
Goffredo to whom, in Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liherata^ the 
heavenly message is sent which starts the Crusade. Ralph 
of Caen exalts Tancred. The author of the Gesta emphasizes 
the great services of Bohemund. Yet in the early 
twelfth century the English Wdliam of Malmesbury could 
assert that Urban’s secret intention was by Bohemund’s 
advice to excite almost the whole of Europe to undertake an 
expedition into Asia, that Urban might engage auxiliaries 
and recover Rome from the Anti-Pope, and that Bohemund 
might gain Illyria and Macedonia, which he claimed as his 

with the French Crusades in Spain, and put its composition in the 
early twelfth century. Coulet has also shown that the Chanson du 
p^lennage was probably written in the twelfth century, at a later 
date than the Chanson de Roland. Cf. Notes, c. ii. 6-8, p. 100.

due, because Robert Guiscard had won these lands from 
Alexius Comnenus.^ In the nineteenth century Sir Francis 
Palgrave,^ who was unjust to the Crusaders, and belittled 
the movement altogether, called ' the anticipated partition 
of the Greek Empire ' the ' final cause of the First Crusade ", 
and compared Bohemund to ' Master Byends " in the 
Pilgrim's Progress, To the Provencal Chronicler Raymond 
of Agiles, the Count of Toulouse, at least after the death 
of the Papal legate, is the central figure of the expedition, 
who might, had he so chosen, have been king of Jerusalem. 
From a twelfth- century Syrian and Armenian source,^ 
even, comes a sort of medieval ' Jenkins" Ear " story 
which tells how Raymond of Toulouse, when on pilgrimage 
to Jerusalem, had an eye struck out in a quarrel with 
the Turks, and how he picked it up, brought it to Rome, 
showed it everywhere and roused the fanaticism which 
led to great armies setting out for Constantinople, 
which they besieged ' for seven years Modern criticism 
turns from these flights of fancy to the simplicity of 
the early records, and sees in the First Crusade the work 
of medieval faith and French idealism directed and 
regulated by the Church. Behind the ' great adven- 
ture " stands the French Pope ; a French bishop, 
Adhemar of Le Puy, the Papal representative, is the 
accredited leader, rector et pastor,^ of the armed pilgrimage ; 
the Franks take the cross, the homes of France and Italy 
are left empty. In his opening chapters ® the author of the 
Gesta has seized, with a sure instinct, on the essentials of the

xxii INTRODUCTION 

Holy War : the motive, the divine command ; the objective, 
the Sepulchre of Christ ; the incentive, the Pope’s inspired 
pleading, which gave form and voice to vague inarticulate 
desires ; the result, the concerted action of Western 
Christendom, responsive to an emotional appeal.^ 

2. Course of the Crusade. 

The history of the First Crusade has been written from 
many different points of view, racial, religious, political, 
economic, military, romantic.^ For this very reason the 
accounts of those who wrote from personal knowledge, 
before the tide of controversy had begun to flow, deserve 
careful study. It is convenient to adopt the usual modern 
division of the First Crusade into a prelude, the ' Crusade of 
the people or the ' Peasants’ Crusade ’, and the main action, 
the ' Crusade of the Princes *, or the * Barons’ Crusade ® 

The second chapter of the Gesta Francorum is occupied 
with the popular Crusade. Three out of the five bands 
which constituted that Crusade, those of Gottschalk, 
Emicho, and Folkmar or Fulk, had already perished or 
dispersed before the Anonymous began to write, but he 
shows special knowledge of the fortunes of Peter the Hermit 
and Walter the Penniless, after they joined forces at Con- 
stantinople.'* He describes, not without prejudice, the dis- 
orderly behaviour of Peter’s followers, the change in the 
attitude of the Emperor Alexius towards them, and their 
tragic adventures in Asia Minor. He speaks of the pride of

the Franks, which led the Germans and Italians to 
separate from them, of the eight days’ waterless siege of 
Exerogorgo, the reputed treachery of the German leader 
Rainald, his sally and defeat, the destruction of the 
followers of Walter the Penniless, the attack on the camp at 
Civitot, the great joy of the Emperor at these disasters and 
the final rescue by the Greeks. In reality Alexius, whatever 
his private feelings may have been, had sent regular supplies 
to the Crusaders, and it was fear of the Greeks which 
eventually induced the Turks to fall back on Nicaea ; the 
Anonymous is unfair to the Emperor throughout. The 
story of Rainald’s treachery, too, is only told by the 
Anonymous and his copyists, and Hagenmeyer doubts its 
truth. But true or false, it seems probable that it came 
from an Italian source. The vivid details of the suffering of 
the thirst-tortured Crusaders at Exerogorgo, couched to 
some extent in Italian- Latin language, the special mention 
of the Lombardi et Longobardi who chose Rainald as their 
leader, the earlier mention of Lombardos et Longobardos 
whom Peter the Hermit found at Constantinople on his 
arrival, all suggest that this chapter of the book was 
written from information derived from the personal 
experience of the author’s compatriots. This, also, would 
account for the bitter feeling against Alexius, who was from 
the first suspicious of Bohemund and his Italian Normans. 
No sooner had the Crusaders set foot on Byzantine soil than 
the question of their relations with the Greeks became 
critical. After the ' Peasants ’ came the ' Princes As the 
three great armies of Northern and Southern France and 
Southern Italy approached Constantinople, the Emperor 
Alexius can hardly be blamed for trying to deal diplo- 
matically with a very difficult situation and to negotiate 
separately with each Crusading leader. In particular he 
dreaded the ambition of Bohemund and the Normans 
of Southern Italy, of whose quality he had already had

INTRODUCTION 


a taste in the invasion of the Balkan Peninsula and the 
battle of Durazzo or Dynachium (io8i). Though he suc- 
ceeded in the end, after blood had flowed on both sides, 
in winning recognition as the feudal suzerain of all the 
Crusading leaders except Raymond of Toulouse and 
Tancred, he only seems to have won over Bohemund by 
substantial concessions and specious promises. The author 
of the Ge^ta makes the Emperor promise a grant of territory 
in the neighbourhood of Antioch, the seat of Bohemund's 
later principality.^ Anna Comnena says that Bohemund 
asked for the high office of Grand Domestic, which would 
have carried with it the military command of the Crusading 
armies.^ 

The Anonymous now writes as an eyewitness, and his 
account of the march from Durazzo to Constantinople and 
the negotiations with Alexius has real original value. He 
ends his first section with the burning of the ‘ fortress of 
heretics . . . with its inhabitants ' and the subsequent 
victory over the Greeks at the river Vardar on February i8, 
1097. His second section carries on the tale through the 
tangled maze of negotiations to the gathering of the 
Crusading forces in Asia Minor, the siege of Nicaea and 
the capitulation of the Turkish garrison to the Greeks on 
May 19, 1097. The Emperor smoothed over the friction 
caused by his retention of the city by means of lavish gifts 
to the Franks. An embassy was dispatched to Egypt to 
negotiate for an alliance with the Fatimites, who were 
hostile to the Seljuk Turks, and by June 29, X097, the

THE FIRST CRUSADE 

Crusading army had started on its march in a south-easterly 
direction across Asia Minor, accompanied by the Byzantine 
representative Tatikios and his troops. The Crusaders 
marched in two divisions, some miles apart. Godfrey of 
Bouillon, Raymond of Toulouse, and Adhemar, Bishop of 
Le Puy, Hugh the Great, and Robert of Flanders were on 
the right, Bohemund and Tancred, with Robert of Nor- 
mundy, on the left. No care seems to have been taken to 
keep the two bodies in touch with one another, an error 
which nearly proved fatal. On the third day of the march, 
July I, the army of Kilij Arslan, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, 
attacked Bohemund’s division in force. The author of the 
Gesta fought with the mounted knights, and his description 
of the battle, though vivid, is imperfect, but by supple- 
menting it from Raymond of Agiles, Fulcher of Chartres, and 
Ralph of Caen, a good idea of the general action can be 
formed.^ The light Turkish horse harassed the heavy-armed 
Frankish cavalry with showers of darts and arrows, as they 
galloped along their lines with wild battle-cries, iaculando 
ao spiculando et . , . sagittando? They had begun to pillage 
the tents in the rear of the Norman army and were mur- 
dering priests and women, when the other division of 
Crusaders, to whom Bohemund had sent an urgent message,^ 
at last came riding to the rescue, and the day was saved. 

' God Almighty sent us help,' writes the Anonymous : 

‘ unless the Lord had been with us in the battle none of us 
would have escaped.' 

The way was now open to Antioch. The Crusaders 
marched by the old Roman road to Iconium and Heraclea,

INTRODUCTION 


where Baldwin of Boulogne and Tancred left the main army, 
crossed the Taurus range into Cilicia, and occupied Tarsus. 
After a sharp quarrel with Tancred over the possession of the 
city, followed by a reconciliation and further conquests, 
Baldwin rejoined the main body, only to leave it again in 
October 1097 for Armenia, and eventually to become the 
adopted heir of the Armenian prince Thoros and the 
founder of the Frankish County of Edessa.^ For the march 
from Heraclea through Lesser Armenia the Gesta Francomm 
is an admirable guide.2 By October 21,1098, the first stage 
of the Crusade ended with the appearance of Bohemund's 
army before the " royal city ' of Antioch. 

The siege of Antioch is the central event of the First 
Crusade and its importance is fully recognized by the 
Anonymous, who devotes four out of the eight sections of 
his book to its history. A battle marks the close of each 
of these sections : Ei-Bara, on New Year's Eve, December 
31, 1097, when the Turks were defeated by Bohemund and 
Robert of Flanders ; the battle of the Lake of Antioch, 
on Shrove Tuesday, February 9, 1098, between the Franks 
and Ridwan of Aleppo and his allies ; the battle of March 6, 
1098, ending in the victory of Bohemund and Raymond 
of Toulouse over the Turks of Antioch after the expedi- 
tion to St. Simeon's Port, and finally the great victory 
over Kerboga on June 28, 1098. 

The city of Antioch, almost impregnable with its splendid 
fortifications, its walls, its ‘ 450 towers ' » and its citadel, 
was held by Yagi Sian {Cassianus), the Turkish Emir and 
commander. Bohemund won the Iron Bridge to the east of 
the city and encamped outside the East Gate, or Gate of 
St. PauL^ The other Crusading leaders took up positions on 

‘ Fulcher of Chartres. Cf. Hagenmeyer, Chron. de la Prem, Crois.,

the north and east, but the north-western Biidge Gate and 
the west and south of the city were at first left open.^ Though 
Genoese ships brought supplies to the Port of St. Simeon in 
November, the Crusaders’ commissariat, transport, and lines 
of communication were ill organized, and by December the 
besiegers were suffering from famine. The last days of 
1097 saw the raid of Bohemund and Robert of Flanders in 
quest of food, which ended on New Year’s Eve with the 
battle of El-Bara, and the ‘ victorious and empty '* return 
of the raiding party to camp. With the New Year scarcity 
and distress increased, and William the Carpenter and 
Peter the Hermit covered themselves with shame by an 
attempt at flight. At this time, too, the Byzantine 
representative, Tatikios, left the camp. The Anonymous, 
who is hostile to inimicus Tetigus, says that he professed to 
be going in search of supplies, but that he ‘ falsely feigned ’. 
Raymond of Agiles makes him cede Tarsus and other 
Cilician towns to Bohemund and then withdraw on the pre- 
text of seeking help. Anna Comnena, on the other hand, 
attributes his departure to the intrigues of Bohemund, who 
was scheming to get Antioch for himself, and warned 
Tatikios of a plot to murder him" as an agent of the 
treacherous Alexius. Von Sybel and Chalandon are 
inclined to accept this view of the matter, but Hagenmeyer 
believes that the famine in camp was a sufficient reason for 
the retirement of Tatikios, and that his subsequent failure 
to send the promised relief embittered the Crusaders 
against him. In weighing the evidence of the Gesta against 
Raymond of Agiles and Anna Comnena, though allowance 
must be made for the author’s loyalty to Bohemund, it must 
always be remembered that Raymond is the ardent partisan

ot the Count of Toulouse, while Anna is a special pleader 
for her father Alexius, and both are more subtle politicians 
than the straightforward anonymous soldier-chronicler.^ 

The first stress of the siege was ended by the victories of 
February 9 and March 6, 1098, the establishment of com- 
munication with the ships at St. Simeon's Port, and the 
building of the fort Machumaria to block the Turkish exit 
by the Bridge Gate. By the end of May Bohemund had 
won a promise from the Council of Crusading leaders that the 
city should be his if he could gain possession of it. In the 
early morning of June 3, it was betrayed into his hands by 
Firuz the Turkish Emir, but though Yagi Sian was slain, 
the Turks still held out in the citadel, and by June 8 the 
relieving army of Kerboga, Emir of Mosul, had come up and 
the Crusaders found themselves transformed from besiegers 
into besieged. Three trying weeks followed, a time of sick- 
ness, famine, and nervous strain, when many lost heart and 
escaped from the beleaguered city.^ It is now that in all the 
contemporary sources the mystic element and the elements 
of myth, saga, and legend become prominent, until the 
psychic phenomena culminate in the finding of the 
Holy Lance on June 14. The author of the Gesta retails 
stories of Kerboga and his mother which are probably 
echoes of camp gossip and prisoners' tales. Raymond of 
Agiles fills his pages with the visions of Peter Bartholomew 
and the other seers to whom the secret of the hidden Lance 
was revealed. Strong in the faith of Christ's direct inter- 
vention in the hour of their greatest peril, the Crusaders 
met and defeated Kerboga on June 28, 1098. In this great 
fight the Anonymous played his part, while his fellow 
chronicler, Raymond of Agiles, bore the Holy Lance in the

battle, and many of the soldiers believed that they saw the 
heavenly hosts mounted on white horses with white stan- 
dards displayed, issuing from the mountains to their aid, 
led by St. George, St, Mercury, and St. Demetrius. By 
nightfall Bohemund's standard was floating over the sur- 
rendered citadel, and Kerboga's army was in full flight.^ 

The end of the Crusade was not to come for more than 
a year, but to the long and eventful period which followed 
the final capture of Antioch the author of the Gesta only 
gives ten chapters. He seems to have become somewhat 
disillusioned and to have lost much of his ' first fine careless 
rapture His loyalty to Bohemund was weakened by his 
hero’s constant quarrels with Raymond of Toulouse, and 
eventually he appears to have joined the Provengal army, 
and to have reached Jerusalem as a humble foot-soldier. 

The last stage of the Crusade, from the battle of Antioch 
to the battle of Ascalon, included four months’ rest at 
Antioch (July to November, 1098), the siege of Marra and 
another month of rest (Nov. 27, 1098, to Jan. 13, logg), 
the march to Area and the siege of the town (Jan. 13 to 
May 13, 1099), the march to Jerusalem (May 13 to June 7), 
the siege of Jerusalem (June 7 to July 16), the election of 
Godfrey as Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre, the elevation of 
Arnulf to the Patriarchal chair of Jerusalem, and the 
campaign and battle of Ascalon (August 9 to August 12, 
1099). 

After the death, on August i, 1098, of the Bishop of 
Le Puy, political xivalry and disputes over the possession 
of the conquered territory bade fair to wreck the whole 
expedition before it had achieved its purpose. In the end,

the rank and file of the Crusaders, the pauperes, tpok the 
matter into their own hands,^ and told Raymond of 
Toulouse that if none of the princes would lead them, they 
would go to Jerusalem by themselves, bearing the Lance, 
with the Lord as their leader. At Marra they even began to 
puU down the walls to prevent further quarrels over the 
town. Raymond of Toulouse, taking this popular move- 
ment as a divine warning, now identified himself with the 
cause of the pauper es, ordered the destruction of Marra, and 
marched barefoot out of the town, on the way to Jerusalem. 
But another long delay occurred at Area, where the princes 
again united forces, and the old jealousies and ambitions 
revived. Raymond of Toulouse, who was probably 
already planning to secure a principality in the neighbour- 
hood of Tripoli, revenged himself on Bohemund by 
favouring the claims of Alexius Comnenus to Antioch. 
The Normans, in return, questioned the genuineness of the 
Holy Lance, and Peter Bartholomew, to whom the first 
vision had been vouchsafed, died before Area, after under- 
going the ordeal of fire to prove the truth of the revelation. 
Not until May 1099 was the forward march resumed, and 
even then Raymond of Toulouse only yielded with great 
reluctance to the urgency of Godfrey of Bouillon, who 
now came forward as the leader of the popular party.^ 
The siege of Area was raised, terms were made with the 
Emir of Tripoli, Bohemund went back to Antioch, and on 
June 7, 1099, “tfi® Crusaders at last reached and invested 
Jerusalem, which had been wrested from the Seljuk 
Turks by the Egyptian Fatimites in August 1098. On 
July 15, 1099, a fierce general assault, the Holy City 
was taken, and the Christian triumph was celebrated by

a ruthless massacre of unbelievers. The author of the Gesia 
was present when the city was won. He mentions the 
elections of Godfrey and of the Patriarch, and he con- 
cludes with the battle of Ascalon, in August 1099, when 
an attempt on the part of the Egyptians to regain lost 
ground in Syria was foiled by the Franks. He probably ^ 
finished his book towards the end of 1099, before the 
deposition of Arnulf from the Patriarchate. He ends, 
as he began, on a religious note, but the key has changed. 
The hope, the single-minded faith, and the spiritual 
exaltation of his opening chapters have grown dim 
in the harsh experience of the realities of war. The 
practical worldly element, always present in the book,^ 
is emphasized in the ease that followed the final effort. 
His ' great joy ' and thanksgiving after the victory of 
Ascalon are for the material rewards of righteousness, 
wheat and cheese, bread and oil, and ' all good things \ Yet, 
quite at the last, as he writes the accustomed doxology, his 
vision clears, he turns from the earthly to the heavenly 
Jerusalem, and adds to his usual formula the words Dicat 
omnis spiritus Amen.^

5 Balduinus comes de Monte. Isti potentissimi milites et 
alii plures, quos ignore, venerunt per viam quam iam

imperator iusserat dari mercatum, sicuti erat in ciuitate,

15 non estis, vt cum Turcis praeliare valeatis.' Ipsique 
Christiani nequiter deducebant se, quia palatia vrbis

ecclesiae erant coopertae, et vendebant Graecis, vnde

Alaxnanni similiter ; et intrauerunt in Romaniam, et per 
quatuor dies ierunt vltra Nicenam vrbem, inuenerunt- 
que qnoddam castrum, cui nomen Exerogorgo, quod 
erat vacuum gente. Et apprehenderunt iUud, in quo 
inuenerunt satis frumenti et vini et carnis, et omnium 30 
bonorum abundantiam. Audientes itaque Turci quod 
Christiani essent in castro, venerunt obsidere illud. 
Ante portam castri erat puteus, et ad pedem castri tons 
viuus, iuxta quern exiit Reinaldus insidiari Turcos. 
Venientes vero Turci in die dedicationis S. Mikahelis, 3S 
qui est III. Kal. Octobris, inuenerunt Reinaldum et qui 
cum eo erant ; occideruntque Turci multos ex eis, alii qui 
remanserunt viui fugerunt in castrum, quod confestim 
Turci obsederunt, eisque aquam abstulerunt. Fuerunt- 
que nostri in tanta afflictione sitis, vt flebotomarent 40 
suos equos et asinos, quorum sanguinem bibebant; 
alii mittebant zonas atque panniculos in piscinam, et 
inde exprimebant aquam in os suum ; alii mingebant in 
pugillo alterius et bibebant ; alii fodiebant humidam 
terram, et supinabant se, terramque sternebant super 45 
pectora sua pro nimia ariditate sitis. Episcopi vero et 
presbyteri confortabant nostros, et commonebant ne

Christi et nolite eos timere qui vos persequuntur, sicut 
Dominus dicit : Nolite timere eos qui corpus occi- so 
dunt ; animam vero non possunt occidere."' ’ Haec

noluenint, capitalem sententiam susceperunt ; alios, 
quos coeperunt viuos, adinuicem diuiserunt quasi cues ; 
alios miserunt ad signum et sagittabant eos ; alios 
vendebant et donabant quasi animalia. Quidam con- 
60 ducebant suos in domum suam, alios in Corasanum, 
alios in Antiochiam, alios in Aleph, aut vbi ipsi manebant. 
Isti primo felix acceperunt mart3n-ium pro nomine 
Domini lesu. Audientes denique Turci, quod Petrus 
heremita et Guualterius sine habere fuissent in Cyuito, 
65 quae supra Nicenam vrbem est, venerunt illuc cum 
magno gaudio, vt occiderent illos et eos qui cum 
ipsis erant. Cumque venissent laetantes, obuiauerunt 
Guualterio cum suis, quos Turci mox occiderunt. 
Petrus vero heremita paulo ante ierat Constantinopolim, 
70 eo quod nequibat refrenare illam diuersam geniem, 
quae nec ilium, nec verba eius audire volebat. Irruentes 
vero Turci super eos occiderunt multos ex eis ; alios 
inuenerunt dormientes, alios iacentes, alios nudos, quos 
omnes necauerunt ; cum quibus quendam sacerdotem 
75 inuenerunt missam celebrantem, quern statini super 
altare martyrizauerunt. lUi vero qui euadere potuerunt,

scilicet comes de S. Aegidio Raimundus, et Podiensis

Richardus de Principatu, Rotbertus comes Flandrensis, 5

1097 Egressi de Castoria intrauimus Palagoniam, in qua erat 
50 quoddam haereticorum castrum, quod vndique aggressi

sit enim comes de Russignolo cum fratribus suis. Venit 
itaque exercitus imperatoris, et inuasit comitem cum 
fratribus suis, et omnes qui erant cum eis. Quod audiens 
Tancredus rediit retro, et proiectus in flumen natando 
60 peruenit ad alios ; et duo millia miserunt se in flumen 
sequendo Tancredum. Tandem inuenerunt Turcopulos 
et Pinzinacos dimicantes cum nostris, quos repente

et claritatem diei ; altae voces intus et extra. Mulieres 
christianae vrbis veniebant ad mUri fenestras, spectantes 
misera fata Turcorum, et occulte plaudebant manibus, 75 
sicut mos erat illarum. Hermenii et Suriani, iussu 
maiorum Turcorum, inuiti seu spontanei, sagittas iacie- 
bant foris ad nos. Mortui sunt etiam in anima et cor- 
pore, duodecim Ammiralii de Turcorum agmine in praelio 
illo, et alii prudentissimorum et fortiorum militum, 80 
qui melius ciuitatem pugnando defendebant, numerus 
quorum fuit mille et quingenti. Alii qui remanserant 
viui, iam amplius non audebant clamitare vel garrire 
in die siue in nocte, sicut ante solebant. Omnes itaque 
nos et illos solummodo separauit nox, noxque diuisit g-

no dolentes, nihil aliud agebant nisi flere et vlulare. Tertia 
vero die coepimus simul iuncti cum gaudio magno 
aedificare castrum supradictum, de lapidibus scilicet, 
quos abstraximus de tumulis Turcorum. Peracto itaque

runt se denique nostri et vna voce concorditer dixerunt : 

' Eligamus vnum ex nobis, qui robuste teneat illud 
castrum et nostris inimicis prohibeat montaneas et 
plana et introitum vrbis ac exitum/ Plures vero ex illis 
proMbentes se illud hospitari, nisi forte fuissent multi in 10 
vnum. Tancredus igitur primus protulit se ante alios, 
dicens : ' Si scirem quid proficui mihi attigerit, ego 
sedule cum meis solummodo hominibus corroborarem 
castrum, et viam per quam inimici nostri solent fre- 
quentius saeuire viriliter deuetabo illis.' Qui continuo 15 
spoponderunt ei quater centum marcas argenti. Non 
adquieuit Tancredus, quamquam solus erat, tamen per- 
rexit cum suis honestissimis militibus ac seruientibus, 
et extemplo abstulit vndique viam et semitam Turcis, 
ita vt nulli auderent ex eis iam timore eius perterriti 20 
extra vrbis portam exire, neque propter herbam, neque 
propter ligna, neque propter vUa necessaria. Remansit 
vero ibi Tancredus cum suis, coepitque vehementer 
vbique coangustare ciuitatem. Ipsa quoque die veniebat 
maxima pars Hermeniorum et Surianorum secure de 25 
montaneis, qui ferebant alimenta Turcis in adiutorium

clamabamus. Nunc coeperunt ilico mirabiliter ascendere ; 
ascenderunt tamen, et cucurrerunt festinanter in alias

dabant sententiam ; fratrem quoque Pirri occiderunt, 
Interea forte rupta est scala, per quam noster erat 
ascensus ; vnde inter nos orta est immensa angustia et 
tristitia. Quanquam autem scala fuisset fracta, tamen

exercitu, cui nomen Petrus, cui antequam ciuitatem 
intraremus apparuit S. Andreas apostolus, dicens : ' Quid 
agis, bone vir ? " Cui ille respondit : ‘ Tu quis es ? ’ Dixit 
ei apostolus : ‘ Ego sum Andreas apostolus. Agnoscas fili, 5 
quia dum villam intraueris, vadens ad ecclesiam B. 
Petri, ibi inuenies lanceam Saluatoris nostri lesu 
Ckristi, ex qua in crucis pendens patibulo vulneratus est.' 
Haec omnia dicens apostolus continue recessit. Ipse 
autem timens reuelare consilium apostoli, noluit indicare ro 
nostris peregrinis. Estimabat autem se visum videre et 
dixit ad eum : ‘ Domine, quis hoc crediderit ? ' In ilia 
vero hora accepit eum S. Andreas et portauit eum vsque 
ad locum vbi lancea erat recondita in terra. Iterum cum 
essemus ita vt superius diximus, venit S. Andreas rursus 15 
dicens ei : ‘ Quare non abstulisti lanceam de terra, vt ego 
tibi praecepi ? Scias reuera, quia quicunque lanceam 
hanc portauerit in bello, nunquam ab hoste superabitur.' 
Petrus vero continuo reuelauit mysterium apostoli, 
hominibus nostris. Populus autem non credebat, sed 20 
prohibebat, dicens : ^ Quomodo possumus hoc credere ? ' 
Omnino enim erant pauentes et protinus mori putabant. 
Accessit itaque ille et iurauit hoc totum veracissimum 
esse, quoniam ei S. Andreas bis in visione apparuerat, 
eique dixerat : ' Surge, vade et die populo Dei, ne timeat, 25

Turcos, Arabes et Sarracenos, quos inuaserunt nostri

namque fons, qui est ad radicem mentis Syon, sustinebat 30

quam enim venit nuntius nostrarum nauium, acceperunt 
inter se nostri seniores consilium, quemadmodum mitte- 
rent milites qui fideliter custodirent homines et naues 
in portu laphiae. Summo autem diluculo, exierunt 35

vero illi quod non possent stare ante Francorum 
fortitudinem, timore nimio perterriti, verterunt scapulas 
retro, quos nostri persequentes fere per spacia quatuor 
6o milium, occiderunt multos ex eis, vnumque retinuerunt 
viuum, qui noua eis per ordinem diceret ; retinuerunt 
quoque centum et tres equos. In eadem obsidione tanta 
oppressione sitis fuimus grauati, vt sueremus coria 
bourn et bufalorum in quibus deferebamus aquas fere per 
6$ spacium sex milliariorum ; ex illis quippe vasculis foetida 
^debamur aqua, et quantum ex olida aqua et hordaceo

qua parte ciuitas esset magis languida, iiluc in quadam 10 
nocte Sabbathi deportauerunt nostram machinam et 
ligneum castnim in orient alem partem. Summo autem 
diluculo erexerunt ea et aptauenint et ornauerunt 
castrum in prima et secunda et tertia feria. Comes 
namque S. Aegidii a meridiana plaga reiiciebat suam 15 
machinam. Interea in tanta pressura sitis fuimus 
districti, vt vnus homo pro vno denario non posset ad 
sufiicientiam habere aquam aut extinguere sitim suam. 
Nocte vero ac die, in quart a et quinta feria, mirabiliter

inuaderemus earn, ordinauerimt episcopi et sacerdotes 
praedicando et commonendo omnes, vt processionem Deo 
in circuit u Hierusalem celebrarent, et orationes atque

feria, summo mane, vndique aggredimur vrbem, et nihil 25 
ei nocere potuimus, eramusque omnes stupefacti ac in 
nimio pauore. Appropinquante autem hora scilicet in 
qua Dominus noster lesus Christus dignatus est pro 
nobis sufferre patibulum crucis, nostri milites fortiter 
pugnabant in castello, videlicet dux Godefridus, et 30

liati sunt nostri vt implerent foueam, feceruntque praeco- 
nari vt si aliquis illam foueam portasset tres petras, 
vnum haberet denarium. Perdurauit vero haec impletio 
per tres dies et noctes. Tandem plena fouea, conduxerunt 
45 castellum iuxta murum. Illi autem qui intus erant 
mirabditer praeliabantur cum nostris, igne et lapidibus. 
Audiens itaque comes quod Franci essent in vrbe, suis 
dixit hominibus : ' Quid tardatis ? Ecce omnes Franci' 
genae iam sunt in vrbe.' Ammiralius itaque, qui erat 
50 in Turri Dauid, reddidit se comiti, eique aperuit portam, 
vbi peregrin! persoluere solebant tributa. Intrantes 
autem nostri ciuitatem peregrin! persequebantur et 
occidebant Sarracenos vsque ad Templum Salomonis, 
in quo congregati, dederunt nostris maximum bellum per 
55 to turn diem, it a vt sanguis illorum per totum templum

nostri masculos et foeminas sat in templo, et occiderunt 
quos voluerunt, et quos voluerunt retinuerunt viuos. 
Super templum vero Salomonis erat maxima paganorum

Bongars divides his text into fonr books and thirty-nine 
chapters. The editors of the Reciteil des historiens des croisad&s 
keep the four books, but subdivide them into fifty-five chapters. 
Hagenmeyer omits the division into books, but retains the 
thirty-nine chapters, and adds chapter-headings and numbered 
sub-sections. The references in the following notes are to

I. Gain e suis vemoti sunt : all the MSS. read Galliae {Gallia) 
suis remotae {remote) sunt. The form Galli e only occurs in 
Bongars and in Tudebod. The Recueil editors follow Bongars, 
but Hagenmeyer adopts the reading Galliae {Gallie), because 
it is found in all the MSS., in particular in B, which he regards 
as nearest to the original, while the awkward construction 
suggests an early origin. For the retention of Galli e despite 
the consensus of MS. readings in favour of Gallia it may be 
argued that Bongars is in agreement with the early plagiarist 
Tudebod, and that it would be as easy for copyists to turn 
Gain e into Gallia and thus avoid the clumsy repetition of 
Galli in two consecutive sentences {lamiamque Galli. . . . 
Fecerunt danique Galli) as for Tudebod and Bongars to reverse 
the process. In a subsequent discussion of the date of Peter 
the Hermit’s arrival at Constantinople (note : c. ii. 9) Hagen- 
meyer rejects the reading of all the MSS., including B, and 
follows Bongars and Tudebod. It would seem more logical 
for these two passages to stand or fall together, as they rest 
on much the same authority. Hence, in the present edition, 
the text of Bongars has been retained in both cases. 

3. Hungariaa . . . regionam : King Coloman succeeded his 
father, Ladislaus I, the Saint, in 1095. 

3-4. Petrus heramita lEremital : Peter the Hermit, called by 
Anna Comnena KouKouTrerpo?, ^ Cowled Peter ’, Petrus Cucul- 
latus, or ' Peter kin ’, from a Picard word, keukiot, little 
(Ducange, Notae ad Amiae Alex.). Born in or near Amiens in 
Picardy, Peter became a monk, an ascetic, and a leader and 
preacher of the ‘ People’s Crusade’ of 1096, though his claims 
to be ' the first author ’ {primus auotor, Alb. of Aix, Lib. i, c. ii) 
of the great expedition must be regarded as legendary. They 
rest mainly on such comparatively late, romantic, and literary 
authorities as the Historia belli sacri, Albert of Aix, William of 
Tyre, and La Chanson d' Antioohe. 

4. dux Godefridus : Godfrey of Bouillon, or of Boulogne, 
Duke of Lower Lorraine. He was called Godfrey of Bouhlon 
from his castle and County of Bouillon in the Ardennes, near the 
French frontier of the duchy of Lower Lorraine. Godfrey was 
the son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne (B. sur mer). By his 
second wife, Ida, sister of Godfrey the Hunchback, Duke of 
Lower Lorraine, Eustace II had three sons. Eustace III, 
Count of Boulogne (notes, c. xxxviii), Godfrey, ' Advocate of

the Holy Sepulchre’, and Baldwin, who succeeded him on the 
throne of Jerusalem. Godfrey was the adopted heir of his 
uncle Godfrey the Hunchback. In 1076 he succeeded to the 
family lands, including Bouillon, and to the March of Antwerp. 
In 1089, after he had fought on the Imperialist side in the War 
of Investiture, the Emperor Henry IV granted him the duchy 
of Lower Lorraine. When in 1096 he started for the Holy Land, 
he pledged his castle of Bouillon to the Bishop of Liege and sold 
some of Ms hereditary estates. His legend connects with 
Lohengrin and the ‘Swan Knight’. He is one of the ‘Nine 
Worthies of Christendom ’. G. Richter, Annalen dcr deutsch,

lord of Conches. She accompanied Mm on the Crusade, but

nected the Elbe with the Middle Danube, and branched oil to 
the Black Sea and to the Adriatic. It was begun by Tiberius, 
continued by Trajan, and completed by Constantine the Great. 
Charles the Great had relations with both the Patriarch of 
Jerusalem and the Caliph of Baghdad Harun ar-Rashid, 
though the legend of the pilgrimage of Charlemagne and his 
twelve peers to the Holy Places seems to have come into being 
after the First Crusade. Robert the Monk makes Urban II at 
Clermont incite Ms hearers to action by reminding them of the 
deeds of Charles the Great and Ms son Louis, qui regna Tur co- 
rum destruxerunt. He turns the ancient Danube route into 
a military road, made by Charlemagne for Ms army. Cf . Gaston

9. venit Constantino polim Kalendis A ugusti : The Kalends of 
August would be August i. Until the appearance of the 
Recueu edition of the Gesta this date was unquestioned. The 

editors, however, adopted the reading of E, III, Kal, 
Augusts, i. e. July 30, and both von Sybel, in the second 
edition of his Gesch, des ersten Kreuzzuges, and Hagenmeyer, 
ill Peter der Eremite, accepted this emendation. Subsequently, 
Hagenmeyer reverted to his earlier opinion, and gave the date 
as August X in his edition of the Gesta Francorum, 1890, and 
in his Chronologie de la Premiere Croisade (1902), Nearly all the 
MSS. agree with E, but C has in (possibly a mistake for iij) 
kl, augusti, Bongars is supported by two MSS. of Tudebod 
(C and D), which have the reading i. Kal. Augusti, and 
by Guibert of Nogent. Hagenmeyer follows Bongars in 
preference to the MS. authorities, and suggests that the 
figure III in the MSS. is due to a misreading of the last letter 
of the previous word, Constantinopohm (note, c. ii. i, cf. ii. 36).

28. Exerogorgo. The position of this fort or castle has not 
been satisfactorily determined. Michaud, Le Prevost, 
following Poiijoulat, and the Recueil editors, identify it with 
Eski-Kaleh (old castle), but Hagenmeyer has shown the 
topographical difficulties in the way of accepting this identifica' 
tion. Anna Comnena and Albert of Aix say that the Crusaders 
had to take the castle by force of arms (Hagenmeyer, opera cit., 
Chron. de la Prem, Croisade, pp. 39, 40). 

36. qiii est in, Kal. Octohris : Hagenmeyer omits these words, 
as a later interpolation in MSS. G (Bongars) and E (ER). He 
attributes the in Kal. of Bongars to a mistaken reading of the 
MS. figure III {%ij Kal) On the other hand, the in of Bongars* 
original MS. may be the source of the III in E. In a previous 
case (c. ii. 9) Hagenmeyer argues that copyists may easily have 
read im as III. Ill Kal. Octob. is the right date. Sept. 29. 

40. fleboiomarent : fiebotomare, ((p'Xe^orofii^o) to bleed. 

42. piscinam : piscina is an Apulian word for cistern, here used 
for a drain or sewer. Piscinae enim vocabulo passim A puli utun~ 
tur, ad significandas cisternas (Ducange, Gloss .) . The use of this 
local word is an indication of the nationality of the Anonymous. 

50. Nolite tinier e : Matt. x. 28. 

59. signum : target. 

60. Corosanum {Corrozanam (c. xviii), Corrozanum (c. xxi)]: 
Khorasan, the region south-east of the Caspian Sea which had 
formed part of the Caliphate of Harun ar-Rashld (786-809). 
It had been conquered by the Seljuk Turks and was now 
nominally under the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad, actually under 
the Turkish sultan. The Anonymous treats it as a province of 
Persia, lying east of Antioch (c. xxi). Einhard ( Vita Karoli, xvi) 
calls Harun ar-Rashid Aaron rex Persarum. 

61. Aleph \Alech (E)] : Haleb, Aleppo. An emirate, ruled 
by Ridwan in 1096. 

64. Gtiualievius sine habere : ' Sensaveor *, ' Sine pecunia *, 
' Walter the Penniless *. He and his three brothers went with 
their uncle, a French knight, Walter of Poissi {Galterius de 
Pexeio)^ (cf. Ord. Vit. Lib. ix). Le Provost suggests the 
derivation of the nickname from Boissi-sans^Avoir, near 
Montfort TAmauri. Robert the Monk calls Walter primicerius 
et signifer agminis Eremitae. He was killed at Civitot. 

Cyuifo, Ciuitc \Civetot, Civitot^ Chevetof ] : The editors of 
the Recueil identified this place with the modern Gemlik or 
Kemlik, the ancient Cius, on the Gulf of Mudania. This was 
the view of Peyr6 {Hist, de la Croisade, 1809). But Paulin 



CHAPTER II 


103 

Paris had already shown, in his edition of Villehardouin’s 
Conqueste de Constantinople {Soc. de rHist. de France, 1838), 
that Civitot must be placed on the Gulf of Nicomedia. Ville- 
hardouin, an eyewitness, writes : * Li Civetot siet ausinc sor le 
goEre de Nichonmie, de Tautre part devers Nique.’ (Cf. Chans. 
d'Ant., i. p. 22, note 3). Anna Comnena makes Helenopolis the 
camping-place of Peter the Hermit’s host, and Hagenmeyer, in 
an exhaustive discussion of the subject in Peter der Eremite 
(pp. 180-4), summarized in Gesta Francorum, ii. 8, note 65, 
locates Civitot in the immediate vicinity of Helenopolis on the 
Gulf of Nicomedia. The name Civitot comes from the Greek 
fcif-ioiTos:, anchorage, roadstead- Hence it was given to the 
harbour which was built near Helenopolis, the modern Hersek. 

86. Persidem : cf. notes, c. xxi. 


CHAPTER III. Page 5 

1. Sclauinia : Croatia and Dalmatia ; per Dalmaiiam, 
according to Fulcher of Chartres. Cf. Raym. of Agiles : 
Sclavonia est tellus deserta et invia et montuosa, uhi nec /eras 
nec volucres per ires hehdomadas vidimus. 

2. comes de S. Aegidio Raimundus : Raymond of St. Gilles 
(S. Aegidius), south of Nimes, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, 
called ' 2 ayy€kr ]9 by Anna Comnena, Sanjil {Saint Gilles) by 
Ibn el-Athir, In a charter to Cluny of 1096 he styles himself 
comes Tolosanorum et Rutenensium (Rouergue), dux Narhonae, 
marchio Provinciae (Mansi, xx. 938, old ed.). He was the 
second son of Pons, Count of Toulouse, and on his father’s 
death he divided the inheritance with his brother William, who 
became Count of Toulouse. He subsequently acquired the 
County of Toulouse, and kept it after his brother’s death. He 
married the daughter and heiress of Bertrand, Count or 
Marquis of Provence, but the marriage was dissolved, as within 
the forbidden degrees of kinship. His second wife was an 
Italian-Norman, of the house of Hauteville; his third wife, 
a Spaniard of the ruling house of Castile, accompanied him on 
the Crusade. He seems to have been over fifty when he took 
the cross in 1095, but an Eastern chronicler states that he 
had already made a pilgrimage, to Jerusalem, and had lost an 
eye in a quarrel with the Mohammedans. (Cf. Introd., p. xxi.) 
This story is unsubstantiated, but Raymond appears to have 
been one-eyed, vir monoculus (cf. Guib. of Nogent, W. of 
Malmes.). He is also said to have fought against the Moors in 
Spain. For his later history, cf. notes, cc. xviii, xxxi, xxxiii, 
xxxiiii, XXXV, xxxix. He died in the Holy Land in 1105 
(Vaissdte et Devic, Hist, du Languedoc, hi, nouv. 6d. 1873-89). 

2-3. Podiensis episcopus : Adh6mar de Monteil, Bishop 



NOTES 


104 

of Le Puy in Auvergne, the Papal legate and representative 
on the Crusade. The Crusading leaders, in a letter to the Pope, 
call him iimm vicarium. To the Anonymous he was the 
Crusaders' rector et pastor (c. xxx), to Raymond of Agiles he 
seemed * another Moses alter Moyses, He died at Antioch 
on August I, 1098 (cf. Introd., pp. xxi, xxv, xxix). 

3-4. antiquam Romae viam : the Appian Way {Via Appia), 
from Northern Italy to Rome, Brindisi, and Bari. 

4. Boamundus : Bohemund, or Bohemond, eldest son of 
Rohert Guiscard and of his first wife Alberada (Aubree). 
Ordericus Vitalis rightly calls him Marcus Buamundus, for 
his baptismal name was Marcus, and Bohemund, the name 
of a legendary giant, was given to him by his father iocunde 
as a nickname. Bohemund was the chief leader of the Italian- 
Norman Crusaders and is the hero of the first part of the Gesta 
Francorum (cf. Introd., pp. xiii-xv, xx-xxi, xxiii—xxx). 

5. Richardus de Principafu : son of "S^hlliam, Prince of 
Salerno, who was step-brother of Robert Guiscard. He married 
Tancred's sister. He took part in the battle of Dorylaeum 
(c. ix), sided with Tancred in his quarrel with Baldwin at 
Mamistra, settled in the Holy Land, and in 1100 was taken 
prisoner with Bohemund by Danishmend of Sivas. 

Rotberius comes Flandrensis : Robert ‘ of Jerusalem 
Count of Flanders, son of Robert Friso Count of Flanders who 
died in 1093. In 1099-1100 Robert the Crusader returned to 
Europe. He is called Georgii filiits, { lifils saint Jorge, Chans, 
d’Ant., Ch. vi) . He brought back an arm of St. George from the 
Crusade. 

6 . Rotberius Normannus {comes de Normannia, Normanniael : 
eldest son of William, the Conqueror of England. To raise 
money for the Crusade he pledged his duchy of Normandy to 
his brother William Rufus (E. A. Freeman, W, Rufus, i). 

Hugo Magnus : Hugh, Count of Vermandois, brother 
ot Philip I, King of France. Li quens Hiies-li-maines, frere au 
roi Phelipon {CJians, d' Ant., Ch. ii). The by-name Magnus 
seems to be due to a misunderstanding of the French word 
maines (from minus. Mod. moins), younger. Cf. Chroniques 
universelles : Du roi Henri remesent dui fit, Phelipes ot non li 
ainsnes ; li autres ot non Hues, en sousnon li maisnes. 

Eurardus de Puisatio : son of Hugh I, Seigneur of Le 
Puisac or Puiset near Janville, between Chartres and Orleans. 
He took an active part in the Crusade, both at Antioch and at 
Jerusalem. 

7. Achardus de Monte Merloi {A, de Mommellou (c. xxxvii), 
candidus capite (Alb. of Aix: Lib. II, c. xxiii)]; Achardus of 
Montmerle (Ddp. Ain) pledged his patrimony to the Abbot and 
monks of Cluny in return for money and mules when he went 
on Crusade. The pledge was never redeemed. According to the 



CHAPTER III 105 

Gesta (c. xxxvii) he was killed on an expedition to Jaffa in June 
1099. (Cf. Hagenmeyer, Chron. de la Prem. Crois., 1096, avrii 12.) 

7-8, Isuardus de Miisone \U sttardus de Musione (CER)] : 
Raymond of Agiles mentions a Provencal Crusader called 
Isoardus comes Dtensis, and Albert of Aix mentions among the 
followers of Raymond of Toulouse, Luodewicus deMonzunz,filhis 
Tirrici de Mimthiliarht {Lib, II, c. xxiii, Rec. des hist, des Crois., 
Hist occ., iv, p. 317), or Dirici de Monthiliart (ed. Bongars). 
An Olivier de Mouson occurs in the Chanson d' Antioche (cf. ii, p. 
348, Table). Musone is possibly, as the editor of the Rectieil 
suggests, the castle of Monsson, which has given its name to 
Pont-d-M Otis son. Mr. W. H. Stevenson connects Isuardus 
with the southern French name Isnard (Eisenhart) . R. of Agiles 
has Hisnardus as a form of Isuardus, R. iii. 249. 

9. Brandosim . . . Barim . . . Otrentmn : Brindisi, Bari, and 
Otranto were the chief ports of embarcation from southern 
Italy for the East. 

10. Wilhelmus Marchisi films : Tancred’s brother (cf. 
note, c. iv. 21-2). 

11. Durachium : the ancient Epidamnus, the modern Durazzo. 

12. dux tllius loci : John Comnenus of Durazzo, the nephew 
of Alexius Comnenus, Governor of Durazzo. 

19—20. burgo vrbis : burgus forensis, fatihourg, suburb. 
Cosmidium on the western shore of the Golden Horn, according 
to Hagenmeyer and Krebs {Kritik Alb. v. Aachen). Pera, on 
the south-east of the Golden Horn, according to von Sybel, 
Kugler (Gesch. d. Krettzz.), and Chalandon (Alex. Comnine). 

24. Turcopolis : the Turcopules were Greek auxiliaries of 
Turldsh origin. Cf. Raymond of Agiles : Turcopoli enim 
dictintur, qui vel nutriti apud Turcos vel de matre Christiana 
patre Turao procreaniur . 

25. Pincinatis {Patzinaks, PetcJienhgues']: the wild tribes, 
probably of Mongolian origin, who had settled between the 
Balkans and the Danube and were constantly at war with the 
Byzantine Greeks. In 1092, after a long period of struggle, 
Alexius I had defeated them with great slaughter. Those who 
survived were formed into a special corps in the Greek army 
(Chalandon, Alex. Comn. cc. i, iv). 

37. portam ciuitatis : the Romanus gate (Porta Sancti 
Romani) in the north-west wall of the city. 

CHAPTER nil. Page 6 

2. Malfi Scafardi pontis : Amalfi, on the Gulf of Salerno. 
The Anonymous shows his intimacy with the locality by dis- 
tinguishing it from Melfi, between Naples and Bari. The siege 
of the rebellious town by the Italian-Normans began in July 
1096. Various explanations are given of the words Scafardi 
pontis. Scaphardus, scaphaldus (Ducange, Gloss.) is the French 

2798 p 



NOTES 


io6 

icliafaud, the English scaffold. It may here mean a raised 
‘ stepped ’ bridge, or the word scaphanlus may here be con- 
nected with scapha, a boat. The early plagiarists felt the 
difficulty. Tiidebod writes Scaphardi Malfi scilicet Scaphardi 
pontis [Caphardi pontis, Codd, BE} ; Robert the Monk has 
Malphi super litus Scaphardi pelagi. Hagenmeyer suggests 
that this may mean ‘ the Sea of Sicardus from Sicardus, 
prince of Benevento and Salerno, who conquered Amalfi in the 
ninth century. 

6. ostensionem : a sign. 

lo. sigmim : Hagenmeyer follows Tudebod in reading 
sonum. The reading in the Recueil (ER) agrees with Bongars. 

Deus le volt : the Italian Anonymous and the Italian 
author of the Hist, belli sacri use Italianized forms of the 
famous battle-cry, Deus le volt, Deus lo vult {Hist. b. s.) . Bongars 
is here probably nearer to the original MS. than the other 
MSS. of the Gesia which have Deus vult, while the French 
Tudebod writes Deus hoc vult. 

1 6. Rogerius comes: Roger, the 'Great Count’ of Sicily, 
Robert Guiscard’s brother. 

21-2. Taucredus Marchisi films : Tancred, son of Robert 
Guiscard’s daughter Emma, tiis father was apparently either 
a marquis, called Odobonus by Order! cus Vitalis, and William 
by W. of Tyre, or, if the suggestion of Paulin Paris be accepted 
[Chans. d'Ant. ii. 370-2), a Saracen emir, called Makrisi. In 
the Chanson d^AnUoche Tancred is described as le fils Marquis, 
and also as le poulant [poulain, of mixed Christian and Saracen, 
or Frank and S5rrian blood), and le fils d V Amir ant (Emir). 
(Cf. Reciieil, iii. 600 ; de Saulcy, Bibl. de VEcole des Chartes, iv.) 

22. Rainulfus : son of William, Prince of Salerno. 

23. Rotbertus de Ansa : Anse (Dep. Rlione) or Anzi near 
Potenza in southern Italy. 

23- 4. Hermannus de Canni : the ancient Cannae in Apulia. 

24. Rotbertus de Surda valle: Sourdeval (Dep, la Manche), 
according to Le Prdvost (Ord. Vit. iii. 488) (cf. Rohricht, Gesch. 
des ersten Kreus^zuges). 

24- 5. Rotbertus filius Tosfani, et Hunfredus films Radulfi : 
these Crusaders are still unidentified. 

25- 6. Richardus films comitis Raimtlfi : son of the Rainulfus 
whose father was 'S^dll. of Salerno. Nephew of Richardus de 
Piincipatu. 

26. comes de Russinolo^ Russignolo : Ronciglione, north- 
west of Rome ; Roscignolo, near Salerno ; Rossano in Cala- 
bria ; or Roussillon in southern France. 

27, Boello Carnotensis : Boello of Chartres. R. of Agiles says 
that he was the brother of a certain Fulcher of Chartres who 
was the first to mount the Firuz tower at Antioch in 1098. 



CHAPTER nil

Alberedtis de Cagnano : Cagnano is situated to the north- 
east of Aquila in the Abruzzi. Albeiedus was killed at Harenc 
(Areg) (c, xii) according to the Hist. bell. sac. 

28. Hunfredus de Monte Scabioso : Monte Scaglioso, near 
Mat era, in the Basilicata (S. Italy). Humphrey fell in the 
battle of Dorylaeum (c. ix). In cc. ix and xxvi he is called 
Godefredus, and he grants a charter as Goffrediis. 

29-30* Bulgaviae partibus : Bulgaria included Thrace and 
Northern Macedonia. 

32. vallem de Andronopoli : Hagenmeyer suggests Dropoli, 
the valley of the Drino. 

42. Castoviani : the modern Kastur. 

49. Falagomam : the ancient Pelagonia. The Crusaders 
followed the Via Egnatia. 

50. liaereticomm castnim : these heretics may have been 
Paulicians, the heretical allies of the Patzinaks (notes, c. ix) 
(cf. Chalandon, op. cit., p. 184, note 6). 

54. flumen Bardarmn : the river Vardar. The ancient Axius. 

68-9. In yoga imperatoris : yoga is payment, stipendium, 
cf . R, of Agiles : milites de yoga impevatoyis. 

CHAPTER V. Page 9

Gloss.)] : cf. Major domus. Mayor of the palace, comes palatii^ 
See. A palace official of high rank (von Sybel) . 

19. Serra : the ancient Serrhae in Macedonia, modern Sjer 
(Seres), near the river Struma, on the high road to Constanti- 
nople. 

27. Riisam : Ruskoi, or Keshan, in Thrace, the Rossa of 
R. of Agiles, through which the army of Raymond of Toulouse 
passed (Chalandon, op. p. 185, note 5). 

31. Coenam Domini : Cena Domini, Maundy Thursday, 
Thursday in Holy week. The day before was Wednesday, 
April I, 1097. 

41. Pascha Domini : Easter Day, April 5, 1097.

Bosphorus. Cf . W. of Tyre, ii. 8, ecclesiam sanctorum martyrum 
Cosmae et Damiani, quae hodie vulgari appellatione dicitur 
Casfellum Boamundi (Chalandon, op. cit, p. 186). 

24-5. quoniam . . , praeteriret : Anna Comnena knows 
nothing of this promise. 

40. Jioniinium et fiduciam : homage and fealty (Ducange, 
Gloss. Hominium). For the distinction between homage and 



io8 NOTES 

fealty cf. Pollock and Maitland, Hist, Eng. Law, ed. i, Bk, II, 
ch. i, § 6. Homage is 'done’, fealty is ‘ sworn’. The act of 
homage creates the close bond between lord and man, lord and 
vassal, landlord and tenant, the feudal relationship of 
' vassaiism The act of homage is usually followed by the oath 
of fealty {fideliias). Here hominium etfidiiciani are opposed to 
the less compelling oath which the Count of Toulouse took, 
which in its terms resembled the ordinary oath of fealty. 
(Cf. A. Luchaire, Manuel des Institutions Frangaises, 1892, 
p. 184 seq.) 

CHAPTER VII. Page 12 

20. slip lies : stakes or poles, on which the crosses were 
placed, to serve as sign-posts. The army of Raymond of 
Toulouse seems to have used stones to mark its passage 
through ' Sclavinia’. 

CHAPTER VIII. Page 13 

29. ayhalisiae et sagittarii : crossbowmen and archers. 

37. comes Stephanas : Stephen, Count of Blois and Chartres, 
son of Theobald III, Count of Blois, who became Count of 
Champagne in 1047. Stephen married Adela, daughter of 
William the Conqueror. He was the father of King Stephen of 
England. For his later history cf. c. xxvii, notes. 

38. Rogevius de Barnavilla : Le Prevost identifies Barna- 

villa with Barneville-sur-Mer (Manche) . Hagenmeyer suggests 
Baronville, south of Dinand (Namur). Roger fought in the 
battle of the Iron Bridge in 1097 killed in 1098, in 

a sortie from Antioch (cf. Chans, dl Ant. ii. 309). 

48, lacus\ the lake Ascanius. Nicaea was on its eastern shore. 

57- 8. sed . . . lacwn : these words are not in Bongars. They 
are inserted here from the Recue il {ER) and Hagenmeyer, as 
they are obviously needed to complete the passage. 

58- 9. plenas Turcopolis : the troops in the ships were com- 
manded by Butumites. Tatikios (Taticius) and Tzita were also 
sent to reinforce the besiegers of Nicaea with troops, 

CHAPTER IX. Page 17 

5-6. quendam pontem: Hagenmeyer thinks that this was 
the bridge over the river Geukson, the ancient Gallus, a tributary 
of the Sangarius (Sakarija). 

10. vir Boamundus i here there is a lacuna in Bongars, 
indicated by three asterisks between vir and Boamundus, Both 
Flagenmeyer and the editors of the Recueil print vir Boamundus 
without noticing this. The asterisks probably represent an 
ille^ble word in the MSS. used by Bongars. MS. C has 
nohilis vir in this place. Nobilis may well be the missing word. 



CHAPTER IX 109 

tiiougli it may also be sapiens, an epithet which the Anonymous 
is fond of applying to Bohemund (cf. Introduction, p. xiii). 

16. Xtcrc% : the subjects of the Seljuk Sultan of Iconium or 
Rum, Kiiij Arslan or Suleiman II, who is called by R. of 
Agiles and by Fulcher of Chartres Solunannus. The fight here 
described is the battle of Dorylaeum, July i, 1097. Borylaeum 
is the modern Eskishehr. The battle is well described by 
Oman, Art of War, voi. i, Bk. v, c. iii. 

50. Tur corum et A rahum et Saracenorum : the Turks are the 
Seljuks. The Saracens are probably the Fatimite Egyptians. 

69. Agulam [Angulani] ; a name of uncertain application. 
Paulin Paris {Chans, d’ Ant, ii. 305, Agolans) writes : * Je crois 
que c’etoit ies AfEncains de Fez but gives no reasons for his 
belief. Hagenmeyer thinks that the name may be connected 
with snake-like {angids) clothing. A better suggestion is that 
the name is derived from the Arabic aghwdl (more destructive, 
most destructive). Cf, Eng. ghoul, from an Arabic root. 

72. Persarum: cf. Fulcher of Chartres: Turds, scilicet 
paganis Persicis. In the thirteenth century Joinville called 
the leader of the Charismian Turks 'li emperieres de Perse C 
[Hist, de St. Louis, c. 102, § 528.) 

Puhlicanorum : by Puhlicani the Anonymous means the 
Paulicians, a Manichaean sect which had taken deep root in 
Armenia and had spread into other parts of Asia Minor and into 
the Balkan Peninsula. The Paulicians had considerable 
political importance, as reli^ous persecution led them to 
revolt against Christian authority and to ally with the Patzinaks 
against the Byzantine Greeks in Europe, and with the Moham- 
medan powers against the Christians in Asia. Hence they are 
classed with * Turks, Persians, Saracens’, &c. Cf, Chans, 
d' Ant., Chant vii. : 

' Arabi et Persant 

Et tout li Amoraive et li Popelicant 
Et Turc et Medien, une gent combatant, 

Cil de Samaire i furent et tout li Agolant.’ 

(Cf. Chalandon, op, cit., c. iv, p. 103 ; R. L. Poole, Illustrations 
of the Hist, of Med. Thought, c. iii ; Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. iii. 
535 » Gibbon, Dec. and Fall of the Rom. Fmp,, c. liv. ; Ducange,

93. Hernienios, Suranios : Armenians and Syrians. 

CHAPTER X. Page 21 

3-4. Solimanus dux illorum : Kiiij Arslan (Turk, kiiij, sabre ; 
arsldn, lion), Suleiman II, Sultan o*f Iconium, son of Suleiman I, a 
kinsman of Malik Shah. Suleiman II succeeded his father in 
1086. The flight alluded to in the text was from Dorylaeum 
rather than from Nicaea. The dialogue with the ten thousand

Arabs probably eckoes the gossip of the camp and the country- 
side. It is elaborated by Robert the Monk and by Guibert of 
Nogent. 

39-40. ftdt moritia . . . equormn : Hagenmeyer and the 
Recuetl {ER) read eguifum, and Hagenmeyer explains that the 
knights were not literally dead, but as their horses had died 
they ceased to be knights and became foot-soldiers. 

43. muliones : rams or sheep. 

46. Yconio [Ychonio (C), Iconio {Ha), Iconium] : the modern 
Konia. One of the two chief cities of the Sultanate of Rixm. 

52. Emchiam, Her aclea, Eradea: - the ancient Heraclea, 
the modern Eregli. P. Paris would identify it with the ancient 
Cybistra, von Sybel with the ancient Archalla. The ancient 
Claudiopolis has also been suggested (cf. Rec. iii. 767 (Cybistra) ; 
de Saulcy, Bibl. de VEc. des Chavtes, iv. 505 (Archalla)). 

59-60. lllic diuisit se ah aliis Tancredus : here the Anony- 
mous digresses in order to describe the expedition of Tancred 
and Baldwin to Cilicia, an episode for which he is the most 
trustworthy authority, though his report is not that of an 
eye-witness. The pai'enthetical character of the digression, 
which ends wdth the words plurima castra (1. 58), is peiRaps 
indicated by the marginal figure (X.) in Bongars’ text. 

62. valient de Botrenihrot [Brotrentrot {ER), Botenthrot 
(C)] : according to Hagenmeyer, the valley in which the 
modem Bozanta, the ancient Podandus, is situated. Von 
Sybel also identifies Botrenthrot with Podandus, and points out 
that at tliis point the road from Adana to Constantinople 
emerges from the mountains {op, cii., p. 304). The editors of 
the Recueil, Le Pr6vost and others, on the contrary, identify 
Botrenthrot with Giillek Boghas, to the south of Bozanta. 

63. Tarsum [Tharsum (C)] ; Tarsus, in Cilicia, on the river 
Cydnus. The birthplace of St. Paul. The town seems to have 
been inhabited by Greeks and Armenians and garrisoned bv 
Turks (cf. Introd., p. xxv). 

96. Athena: the modern Adana, Albert of Aix says that a 
Burgundian named Welf, with an independent body of troops 
had taken the town from the Turks. Tancred found the gates 
closed, but was admitted after negotiations. Ralph of Caen, with 
greater probability, says that an Armenian was in possession 
and that he invited Tancred to Adana. Archer (Archer and 
Kingsford, The Crusades) apparently accepts Albert’s story ' 
von Sybel follows Ralph of Caen (cf. von Sybel, op, cit,), ' 
Manustra [Mamistm {CER)]: Missis, Messisse, the 
aiicimt Mopsuestia. Albert of Aix and William of Tyre expand 
the bare statement of the Anonymous and make Tancred 
storm the town and massacre the Turldsh garrison. Ralph of 
Caen says that the Tui'ks fled by night. It was here that the 
quarrel between Tancred and Baldwin led to actual fighting 
followed by a reconciliation.

3-4. Hermeniorum . . . terram : Armenia Minor, Lesser 
Armenia, the Armenian colony in Cilicia, which in 1097 was 
nominally subject to the Sultan of Baghdad. It should be 
distinguished from Greater Armenia, south-west of the 
Caspian Sea and south of Georgia. The Byzantine Emperor 
Basil II had weakened the power of the independent Christian 
princes of Armenia by his conquests and annexations, and in 
the second half of the eleventh century their remaining terri- 
tory was conquered by the Seljuk Turks. The ancient capital, 
Ani, was taken, and in 1071 the Byzantine Greeks were de- 
cisively defeated on the Armenian battlefield of Manzikert. 
Armenian Christians, flying before the Turks, had occupied the 
Taurus ranges, and had found new homes in Mesopotamia, in 
the country between the Euphrates and the Taurus, and in 
Cilicia. The Anonymous seems to include part of Cappadocia 
in ' the land of the Armenians as the Crusaders’ route from 
Heraclea to Caesarea does not run through Lesser Armenia (cf. 
Hagenmeyer Gesta Franc, c. xi. i, note 3 ; von Sybel, op. cit. \ 
Oman, Byz. Emp., cc. xix— xx ; W. B. Stevenson, Crusaders in 
the East, pp. 21 seq., 175 seq^. 

5. quoddam castrum : thus castle has not been satisfactorily 
identified. Hagenmeyer guesses that it was either Kilisse 
Hissar, or, more probably, Develfi Karahissar. Baudri of 
Dol says it was near the town of Alfia. Roger of Wendover 
(ann. 1097) says that Robert duke of Normandy took a city, 
called Azena, and gave it to Simeon, one of his knights. But 
no traces of a town called Adfia or Azena have been found in the 
district (cf. note, c. xi. 18). 

7. Symeon : Hagenmeyer thinks that he was probably one 
of the smaller Armenian princes, ‘ native to the region not, 
as R. of Wendover says, a follower of Robert of Normandy. 

12. Caesaream Cappadociae: the ancient Mazaca, the 
chief city of Cappadocia, the residence of the old Cappadocian 
kings, and an important ecclesiastical centre. It was taken and 
plundered by the Turks in 1067 or 1068. Baudri of Dol 
speaks of it at the time of the First Crusade as ad solum 
diruia. 

13. quandam ciuitatem : B. of Dol. and Ord. Vit. call this city 
Plastencia. Hagenmeyer would identify it with the modern 
Hadschin, or with Saris on the road from Caesarea to Marash. 
It is probably the stronghold {flrmissimum castrum) mentioned 
by Stephen of Blois in his second letter to his wife, as the place 
of refuge of the Turkish prince Assan. 

18. Petrus de Alpihus [de AUphi, de Aliph, Aluph (Tud.), 
Alphia (Baudri), Alfia (Ord. Vit.)]: Baudri and Ordericus 
may have evolved the town Alfia (c. xi. 5) from this name. 



II2 


NOTES 


Le Provost identifies this Peter with a Provencal Pierre d’ Aulphs, 
who successively served Robert Guiscard and the Greeks. 
Hagenmeyer refers to the princeps mentioned by Stephen of 
Blois (Epp. ii.), to whomthefirmissimumcastrum {' Plastencia ') 
was entrusted, and thinks that P. de Alpibus was the Petrus 
Anpha who is said by Anna Comnena to have fled from Antioch. 
(Cf. notes, c. xxvii) (cf. Chalandon, op. cit., p. 194, ' Tatikios 
qu’accompagnait Pierre d'Aulps \) 

27. Coxon : the modern Gueuksun, on the river of the same 
name. The ancient Cocussus. 

29. alumni : inhabitants. 

32“3. Turd . . , discessissent : this was a false rumour. 
Cf. xi. 25, audierunt Turcos esse in czzntate. 

35-6. Petrum de Castellione : possibly Castillon in the 
Dordogne (D6p. Gironde) (Hagenmeyer). Tudebod and Hist. b. 
sac. say that he helped to defend Machumaria (c. xviii). 
He fought well at Marra (c. xxxiii). Albert of Aix mentions his 
good service at the siege of Nicaea, and at the later siege of 
Arsuf in 1099. 

37. Petrum de Roasa : Le Prdvost suggests Roaix (Vau- 
cluse). 

Petnm Reimundum de Pul [de Alto Pullo . . . (R. of 
Agiles)] : one of the Machumaria defenders. A follower of 
Raymond of Toulouse, he took part in the Invention of the 
Holy Lance. He died at Antioch, after its capture by the 
Crusaders. 

43. Vallem de Rugia : Rugia (cf. c. xxxiii) is the modern 
Riha. The valley lay east of Antioch. 

45. persecutus est valde: Tudebod adds : misitque plenam 
hastam lahris et nasibus Turcoriim Raimundo comiti. 

48. Rusam ciuitatem: Bongars omits the name Rusam, 
which is found in E and other MSS. and in Tudebod. The 
editors of the Recueil are mistaken in confusing Rusa with 
Ru^a. Fulcher of Chartres and other contemporary chroniclers 
distinguish between them. This Rusa remains unidentified. 

49-50. diahoUcam montanam : the eastern chains of the 
Antitaurus, between Cocussus and Marash. 

53. saumarius : a sumpter-horse or pack-horse, a sump ter 
mule. Guib. of Nogent calls dogs sagmarii. (Cf. Ducange, 
Gloss.) 

61. Marasi ; [Marasim,] Marash. The town, which Fulcher 
of Chartres says was completely destroyed in 1114, stood high, 
overlooking a fertile plain. It was under an Armenian prince 
and was apparently mainly inhabited by Armenians, though 
Albert of Aix says that the castle or citadel had been occupied 
by Turks, who fled before the Crusaders arrived. He also says 
that the wife of Baldwin died at this time near Marash. 



CHAPTER XI 


113 

64. Boamundus : Bohemnnd had left the main army, to 
pursue the Turks. 

65-6. vallem, in qua vegalis ciuitas Aniiochia sita est: the 
plain of Antioch, a day’s journey in width and a day and a half's 
journey in length, according to Raymond of Agiles. The plain 
is girt about with mountains. The city of Antioch lies on the 
south bank of the river Orontes (cf. cc. xvii, xxxii. Cf. 
Archer and Kingsford, Crusades, c. iv, p. 63). 

67. heato Petro : Antioch was a patriarchate, and St, 
Chrysostom (who was born at Antioch) and St. Jerome had 
taught that St. Peter was its first bishop Aniiochia, in qua 
primicerius Apostolomm Petrus cathedram decor avit pontificalem 
(Baudri of Bol, 10 1, 28. R. iv. 40 C.) 

CHAPTER XII. Page 27 

i~2. pontem Farreum [ferreum] : the Iron Bridge, so called 
from the meaning of its Arabic name {Jis? el Hadid), The 
word farretim, ferretim, may refer to the river Far or Fer 
(Farfar fluvius), which Albert of Aix says flowed beneath it, 
or it may be connected with, ferreus, iron. The bridge crossed 
the Orontes, which is vulgarly called Fer, about eight miles 
to the east of Antioch. Below it the river bends sharply to 
the west. 

2. cur sores nostri: Albert of Aix alone states that this 
force consisted of the mounted followers of Robert of Nor- 
mandy, Roger of Barneville, and Euerard de Poisat (Puisac), 
with 2,000 foot-soldiers. 

13. ante portam ciuitatisi Bohemnnd had now rejoined 
the main army. He took up his position before the East Gate 
of the city, also called St. Paul's Gate, porta orientalis, quae 
dicitur S. Pauli (W. of Tyre,) ; porta, quae respicit ad Persidem 
plagam (Alb. of Aix). 

17. ires portas ciuitatis : the East Gate or St. Paul's Gate 
and two of the three northern gates, the Bridge Gate, the 
Duke's Gate, and the Dog Gate. 

1 8-1 9. alia . . . montanea : Mons Casius, on the west and 
south of the city. The southern walls of Antioch were built 
along a ridge of the hills which ‘ run down from the mountains 
of Ansarieh to within half a mile of the river ' (Archer and 
Kingsford, op. cit., p. 65). 

20. Turd ... in vrbe : Yagi Sian, the Turkish emir, and 
his troops (c. xx). 

30. excommunicatis : the Turks. 

36. Aregh [Harenc, Harem] : a castle, east of the Iron 
Bridge, which commanded the road from Antioch to Aleppo. 
The ruins of this castle may still be seen. 

2798 Q 



NOTES

43-4. duo ex nostris : one of these two was Alberedus de 
Cagnano {Hist. h. sacri, c. 37). Hermannus de Canni lost his 
horse (cf. notes, c. iiii. 23-4, 27). 

48. portam vrhis : St. Pauhs Gate, before which Bohemund 
was encamped. 

52, Boamundi plateam ; the space in which Bohemund 's 
tents were pitched. 

CHAPTER XIII. Page 28 

3. Maregart [Maregarx, Malreguarf]: perhaps the French 
word Mauregard. The fort or castle {castrum) was built on 
a spur of Mt. Casius, to the south of Bohemund’s camp. (Cf. 
von Sybel, p. 325 ; Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. hi. 521.) 

15. stipendium : provisions. 

25. Hienisalem et Damasco et Aleph : Jerusalem was under 
the Turkish emir Sokman ibn Ortok, who was an ally of 
Yagi Sian. It was taken by the Fatimites in 1098. Damascus 
was governed by Dekak, and Aleppo by his brother, Ridwan. 
Dekak, with the Atabeg (minister, tutor, or guardian) Tugh- 
tigin, his stepfather (cf. Abulfeda), and with the emir of 
Emesa, Jenah ed daula, had gathered reinforcements at 
Caesarea to relieve Antioch. It was a body of these troops 
that attacked Bohemund and Robert of Flanders, and were 
repulsed near Elbara, south-east of Antioch. Both sides seem 
to have claimed the victory (cf. Kam^l ad-dln), but the Turkish 
forces did not advance further towards Antioch at this time. 
Stephen of Blois counts this expedition among the ‘ seven 
sieges ’ of Antioch. (Cf. von Sybel, op. cit., c. viii.) 

40-1. Nos . . . reiiertentes : the Anonymous took part in 
the Elbara raid. 


CHAPTER XIV. Page 30 

12. senescalcum : the seneschal or dapifer (steward) was 
one of the most important of the feudal household of&cials. 
Here he is found acting in a military capacity as standard- 
bearer, vexilHfer episcopi (R. of A^les). The seneschahs 
functions usually included military, judicial, administrative, 
and domestic duties (Ducange, Gloss., Smescalcus; A. Luchaire, 
Mamiel des Inst. Frang, 1892, Index, SSnBchal). 

13. fltimen ; the Orontes. 

17. Tancredi montaneam : Tancred had occupied a ruined 
monastery to the west of the city, not far from the George 
Gate. Here, on high ground, he afterwards built his fort or 
‘ castle * (c. xix). (Cf. von Sybel, op. cit., p. 336 ; Hagenmeyer, 
op oil.) 

19. expendio : expendium here means spoliation, devastation. 



CHAPTER XIV ' 115 

36. purpuyatis [yperpents, perpentSy perpre] : the Byzantine 
gold coin vyepn-epo^. The Anonymous equates a purptims^ 
with 15 solidos denafiommy i. e. 180 silver pennies, of which 
12 went to a solidus. The solidus was not a coin at this time, 
but a unit of account, like an English guinea at the present 
day. An ass-load of food might therefore be worth 120 solidos , 
or 1,440 pence. The famine prices in the city and the scarcity 
of food are vividly described by Raymond of Agiles and 
Fulcher of Chartres. Raymond says that corn was so dear 
that it cost 7 or 8 solidos a night to feed a horse. Fulcher says 
that the famished people ate growing crops and nettles, horses, 
asses, camels, dogs, and mice. The very poor even ate the 
hides of beasts. 


CHAPTER XV. Page 31 

I. Wilhelmus . . . Caypentavius : Vicomte de Melun, related 
to Hugh of Vermandois. He had gone through Hungary with 
the Germans under Emicho, escaped when they were cut to 
pieces near Wieselburg in August 1096, was brought to 
Constantinople as a prisoner of the Greeks, and subsequently 
joined the main army of Crusaders. He was a man of gigantic 
statuie, coarse and rude in nature, dictis potens sed opeya 
paycus, in the words of Guibert of Nogent, who cannot pardon 
him for his flight from Antioch. His by-name ' Carpenter ' 
is explained by Guibert : Caypentayucs, non quia f obey lignarius 
asset, sed quia in hellis cedendo, move caypentarii insisteyet, 
dicebatuy ; by Hagenmeyer (P. dey Eremite , p. 18, note i) as " un 
simple sobriquet'; but Brehier {JJighse et VOyient, p. 68) 
calls him Guillaume le Chambellan. (Cf. P. Paris, Chans, d' Ant. 
li. 339.) 

Petrus heremita : after the defeat at Civitot Peter the 
Hermit spent the winter near Constantinople. In 1097 
joined the main Crusading army, and probably marched with 
the pauper as. In the Chanson d'Antioche he is among the 
ribaus. (Cf. P. Paris, Chans, d' Ant. ii. 3, note 3 : " Pierre 
THermite est toujours chef de la pietaille ; puis immddiate- 
ment au-dessous de lui venoit le roi Tafurs ou des Tafurs, 
c'est-a-dire le chef des mendians, des gens sans aveu '.) 

7. vti mala res : ‘ as a thing of nought Cf. Anglo-Saxon 
niding. 

tenda : a tent ; only used in the Bongars edition. An 
Italian form* 

14. Hispania : William the Carpenter had served against 
the Moors in Spain, but, according to Guib. of Nogent : 
foede recessit et innumeros sua aversione fefellit. (Cf. Chans.. 
d'Ant. ii. 339.) 



NOTES 


Ii6 

1 6, Ffancigenae: the Franks. Cf. R. of Agiles, R. iii. 
244 : omnes de Burgimdia et Alveniia et Gasconia et Gothi, 
Frovinciales appellantitr, ceteri vero Francigenae et hoc in 
exeroiiu, inter hostes attiem omnes Francigenae dicehantur. 

26. furtim recessit : William the Carpenter fled to Alexan- 
dretta, where he joined Stephen of Blois, who had escaped from 
Antioch. Albert of Aix says that he went back to Constanti- 
nople and took part in the later Crusade of iioi. 

CHAPTER XVI. Page 32 

1. inimicus Tetigus [Titidus (Tud.), Tatio (R. of Agiles), 
Tatikios, Taticius] : the Byzantine imperial representative, 
who was appointed to accompany and support the Crusaders 
with a force of Greek soldiers, and to take over the cities won 
by them in the name of the Eastern Emperor. He was primi- 
ceriuSy a highly placed palace of&cial and military commander. 
To the Anonymous he is an ' enemy ' because he was opposed 
to Bohemund’s policy and because he left the Crusading army 
in the time of its greatest need. For a discussion of the 
questions arising out of the conduct of Tatikios at Antioch, 
cf. Introd., p. xxvii, (Hagenmeyer, op, oil, ; von Sybel, 
op. cit. ; Chalandon, op. cit. ; Rohncht, op. cit.) 

4. cismare : MSS. B, C, and E, with the Recueil editors, 
omit this passage altogether. Hagenmeyer {Gest. Franc, xvi, i, 
note 4) adopts the reading seminare {al. machinari) from Tude- 
bod. Cismare is derived from the Greek (rxlo-fxa, Lat. schisma. 
a schism. There is an old English form cisme (Oxf. Diet., 
schism). The meaning would be to divide, to separate, or 
perhaps here to feign false opinions, such as a schismatic 
might hold. It is worth noting that the Greek word occurs 
in the passage which treats of the Greek inimicus. It seems 
arbitrary to reject it. 

15. papilio : tent; Fr. pavilion. 

24. Cypnim : Cyprus still formed part of the Byzantine 
Empire. It was in constant communication with the port of 
St. Simeon and Antioch, and was used by the Crusading army 
as a base for supplies. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Simeon, 
had taken refuge in the island. 

CHAPTER XVII. Page 33 

2. gentem Turcorum : Ridwan of Aleppo and his allies. 

13. fluuium et lacum : the Orontes and the great Lake of 

Antioch, to the north-east of the city, in the plain. Abulfeda 
calls this lake Bohayret Antakia\ the Turkish name for it is 
Ah Dengis, Dengis Aga. Cf. Oman, op. cit., voL i, Bk. v, c. iii 
' the great lake of Begras \ ' 



CHAPTER XVII

24. explofatores : Albert of Aix says that these scouts were 
Walter de Dromedart and a newly baptized Turk, Bohe- 
mund’s godson. 

40. conostahtU . . . Rotherto filio Girardi [Conostahilis , comes 
stahuli, constable] : the constable, like the seneschal, was a great 
feudal household official (cf. Luchaire, Man. des Inst. Frang ; 
Index, Comietahle). Robert Fitz Gerard may have been a 
kinsman of Bohemund. He acted as standard-bearer in this 
battle, and is called in the Hist, belli sacri : fortissimus et 
honombilis sigmfev. After the conquest of Jerusalem he served 
under Godfrey of Bouillon. 

52. linguae . . . vexilli : the tongues or points of the banner 
or standard. Bohemund’s banner was red (vuhicitndum, 
F, of Chartres) with a snake on it, according to a Provencal 
version of the Chans, d' Ant. 

59. castrum suum : Harenc. 

68. poYtam ciuitatis : St. PauFs Gate, before which Bohe- 
mund was encamped. The Egyptian ambassadors were 
quartered in this part of the camp. 

69. Ammiraii Bahyloniae [Ammiratus, Amir alius. Am- 
niiravisus] : the modern emir, amir (Ducange, Gloss., sub 
voc.). The word admiral comes from it (Oxford Diet., sub voc,), 
Babylon is Cairo, the seat, since 962, of the heterodox Shiite 
Fatimite Caliphate. The name Babylon, strictly speaking, 
refers to the old fortress, at some distance from the modern 
Cairo, which is said to have been built by one of the later 
Pharaohs to receive the Babylonian mercenaries in the 
Egyptian service (E. J. Davis, The Invasion of Egypt by 
Louis IX of France, &c., 1897). Cf. i Peter, v. 13, ' The 
church that is at Babylon . . . saluteth you The emir 
mentioned in the text was al-Afdal, emir or vezir of the 
reigning Fatimite caliph Mustali (1094-1101). The Franks 
had sent an embassy to Egypt from Nicaea, and their am- 
bassadors had now returned, accompanied by al-Afdal, who 
hoped to conclude an alliance with the Crusaders. 

CHAPTER XVIII. Page 36 

II. Machumariam [Bafumaria (R. of Agiles) ] : Machu- 
maria means a Mohammedan temple or mosque (cf. Machomet, 
c. xxi). There were two mosques on a hill, opposite the Bridge 
Gate, on the right bank of the Orontes, commanding the road 
from Aleppo to the port of St. Simeon. Cf . R. of Agiles : 
habebat . . . civitas pontem quasi inferiori angulo occidentali, 
et monticulum quemdam adversum nos, vbi duae erant bafu- 
mariae et quaedam sepulcrorum casalia. 

17—18. portum S. Simeonis : the harbour at the mouth of 



NOTES 


ii8 

the Orontes. It was also called Sedimn, Sulinus, Suaidieh, and 
by Anna Comnena, Sicdei (Soi>Set). William of Tyre identifies it, 
perhaps erroneously, with the ancient Seleucia (Hagenmeyer, 
Gesta Fmnc. xviii. 2, note ii). St. Simeon and his disciples 
occupied a monastery in the neighbourhood, on Mt.^ Casius. 
Hence the name, ' the poit of St. Simeon ^ Genoese ships were 
l3nng in this harbour. 

26-7. exienmt extra ciuitatem ; by the Bridge Gate, 

34. tllam gentem : the workmen and sailors who were being 
escorted from the port of St. Simeon, to help in the building 
of the fort, 

68. pontis coluniyias : the pillars or piers of the bridge. The 
plight of the retreating Turks, struggling back to the city, was 
desperate, as Yagi Sian had ordered the Bridge Gate to be closed. 

79 duodecim Animiralii : Raymond of Agiles and Albert of 
Aix practically agree with the estimate of the Turkish loss in 
the Gesta, though Raymond does not include those buned 
in the city or drowned in the river. Stephen of Blois more 
than doubles the numbers. Robert the Monk puts them still 
higher, and one manuscript of the Chanson d^Antioche (Chant iv) 
gives a total of 10,000, of whom 1,500 were drowned. 

86. spiculando : throwing darts or javelins. 

107-8, nuntiis Amirahi de Babylone : Albert of Aix says 
that the Egyptian embassy had gone to the port of St. Simeon 
with Bohemund and Raymond of Toulouse, in order to return 
to Cairo. 

1 16. ad portam : this reading is found in MSS. B, C, and E, 
and is accepted by the editors of the Recueil. Hagenmeyer 
rejects it for portam, the reading in Tudebod and in Baudri 
of Dol. As ' port ' is here coupled with ' mountains as there 
was mountainous country to the north of the harbour, and as 
Raymond of Agiles writes, victualium condactoves ire et redire 
a portu potuerunt ; — portiim may be the original word, but the 
authority for portam is strong, and the victory of March 6 
must have given the Crusaders easier access to the Bridge 
Gate {portam vrhis, vhi pons est), over the bridge which their 
new fort (Machumaria) commanded, and to the mountains on 
the left bank of the Orontes. This explanation seems to fit 
the words of c. xix : omnes semitae pene prohibitae . . . erant 
Turds. The great object of the besiegers was to blockade 
the gates of the city. 

CHAPTER XIX. Page 40 

2. indsae : ' trenched 

3. castrum et , . .monasterium : Tancred’s fort (cf. c. xiv). 
It was on high ground to the west of the city, on the left bank 
of the Orontes, opposite the Gate of St. George, the duitatis

Bongars, and in the plagiarists, Tudebod, Baudri, Guibert,

E, omit them. 

15. deuetabo : vetare, to forbid, hinder, veto. 

15-16. coniinuo . . . ar genii : continuo means straightway, 
at once. The mark of silver was a unit of account and weight, 
not a coin. It varied in value at different periods and in 
different places, but it usually, in the Middle Ages, equalled 
either ^ or J a pound sterhng, according to the meaning 
given to the pound. It is sometimes equated with the weight 
of a pound. Marca dicitur pondus argenti vnius librae {Papias, 
eleventh century). Hagenmeyer ^esta Franc, xxxix. 18, 
note 86) accepts this equation. ‘ Eine marca argenti ist ein 
Pfund Silber,' but cf. Ducange, Gloss., Marca : Apud nos . . . 
marca duplicata libram efficit quae dividitur in 16 uncias. In 
England it equalled | of a pound, 13 shillings and 4 pence. 


CHAPTER XX. Page 42 

2. Pirns [Pirrus, Pyrrus, Pyrrhus, Firuz (Ibn ehAthir : 
KamM ad-din), Feirus (W. of Tyre.), Daciens (Chans. d'Ant., 
probably a confusion with Yagi Sian)^ : he has been variously 
described as a Turk, an Armenian, and a Persian, a pervert to 
Mohammedanism, a convert to Christianity, and an Armenian 
Christian. The story of his treachery was embroidered and 
elaborated by writers on both sides. It is found in a picturesque 
form in the Chanson d’Antioche, where Daciens li Turs, 
influenced by what he hears of * the army of God ' (I’ost Dieu) 
from his son, who has been a prisoner in the Crusaders' camp 
and has become a Christian, dreams that God has commanded 
him to deliver Antioch. After conferring with Bohemund, 
and murdering his own too-inquisitive wife, he betrays the 
city, and is finally baptized with his son. Fulcher of Chartres, 
who calls the treachery which gave Antioch to the Crusaders 
fraudem et non fraudem, makes Christ appear twice to * a 
certain Turk ' and bid him surrender Antioch to the Christians. 
Ralph of Caen and Kamal ad-din treat the treachery as the 
result of a grudge against Yagi-Sian. The simple statement 
of the Anonymous is probably accurate enough. Bohemund 
himself, in the letter which the Crusading leaders sent to Urban 
II after the death of the bishop of le Puy (F. of Chartres, R. iii. 
351) writes : Ego Boamundus, conventions facta cum quodam 
Turco, qui ipsam mihi tradidit civitatem, scalas . . . muro

appUcui. (Cf. Hagenmeyer, op, cit. ; von Sybel, op. cif. ; 
Chans, Antioohe.) 

3. piilsahat : examined, questioned. 

7-8. Tfes tmves ciistodio : the fortifications of Antioch, 
muvis et Umibus at antamiiYalihits nmnita (R. of Agiles) were 

* erected by Justinian, and remodelled in the tenth century 
by the engineers of John Zimisces and Basil II * (Oman, 
op. cit, vol. ii, Bk. vii. c. ii, pp. 27-28). The city was taken 
from the Saracens by Nicephorus Phocas and again captured 
by the Seljuk Turks in 1084. The system of fortification was 
justly celebrated, and, combined with the natural defences of 
mountain and river, rendered the place almost impregnable. In 
c. xxxii the Anonymous says that the city was enclosed with 
a double wall with 450 towers on the ‘ greater ' wall. Sir 
Charles Oman gives a clear reconstruction of the defences in his 
Art of War, vol. ii, Bk. vii. c. ii, and a plan of the siege and battle 
of Antioch (vol. i. Plates vii, viii). There was ' a line of curtain, 
4 n which towers weie placed at frequent but irregular intervals \ 
The towers had three storeys, and were about 60 feet high, 

* No one could walk for a quarter of a mile along the enceinte 
without passing through six or seven towers'. It was thus 
quite possible for Firuz to guard three towers, though 
Ralph of Caen only mentions one. The tower by which the 
Crusaders entered the city was at the north-western corner, 
on the mountain flank, above the Gate of St. George. W. of 
T3rre calls it the tower of the * Two Sisters turr%s quae vulgari 
appellaticnie dicitur duarum Sororum. (Cf. plans in Rey, 
ArchitecUire Militaira des Croisas an Syria, Paris, 1871 ; 
B. Heyck, Die Kreuzziige, 1900, p. 39, pp. lo-ii, Plates! 
Cf. Hagenmeyer, op. cit. ; von Sybel, op. cit.) 

18. ingeniare : here, to storm with mihtary engines. 

26. Azimitamm: ivom Cvfirj, fermenktm. Applied to those 
who used unleavened bread for the Sacrament of the Mass. 
Here it may refer to Maronites and Armenian Christians, 
but the name was often given by the Greeks to the Latin 
Catholics . 

53. Malam coronam : ‘ Evil tonsure The corona or 

‘ crown ' was the clerical tonsure. 

64. ascendif Boamundus : Hagenmeyer and the Recueil 
editors here read dascendit, with Tudebod, and explain it 
as ‘dismounted'. Bohemund ‘got down’ from his horse. 
Guib. of Nogent has da aqtio desiluit. 

68 . scalam. From the letter of the Crusading leaders to Urban 
II (F. of Chartres, R. iii. 350, G.) it appears that Bohemund 
himself first fastened the ladder to the wall. Ego Boamundus 
. , . scalas ante diam pariim muro applicui. It was a rope- 
ladder, made of hide, according to Alb. of Aix. When it

broke, Firuz is said by Albert to have thrown down a rope, 
that the ladder might be made fast again. One Eastern 
chronicler makes the Franks get into the city by a grated 
window, which Firuz opens, 

69. merulas : an Italian form. Ramparts, battlements ; 
French creneau (cf. Ducange, Gloss., sub voc.) Menia, moenia, 
in MSS. B and E, and in the Recueil edition. The English 
merlon, the part of the crenelling between the embrasures.

The only Greek sentence in the book, and the Anonymous 
thinks it prudent to translate it (Hagenmeyer, G.F., Einletl, 
P- 38). 

76-7. seruiens Longobardus : Baudri calls this Lombard 
Paganus, and makes him the first to mount the ladder. 
R. of Agiles and R. of Caen ascribe that honour to a Frenchman, 
Fulcherius . . . f rater Budelli Carnotensis (cf. c. iv) or Gonel 
Carnoiensis, (R of Caen). 

79. ires turres habemus : were these the three towers which 
had been entrusted to Firuz ? Von Sybel (op. cit.) treats 
the statement in the Gesta {c. xx. 7. 8) that Firuz guarded three 
tow^ers as an error on the part of the Anonymous. 

82—3. Nos . . . clamahamiis : the Anonymous took part in the 
attack. He entered the city by the postern, not by the ladder. 

86. fratrem , . . Pirri: in the Chanson d'Antioche Firuz 
urges his brother to become a Christian, and when he refuses, 
calls on the Frankish barons, and his brother is killed by 
Count Robert of Flanders. 

90. porta . . . in sinistra parte : R. of Agiles describes this 
porta as posterula. Albert of Aix calls it posticum. It was 
probably one of the small posterns of which there were several 
in the west wall. It would be, as Hagenmeyer points out, 
to the north of the tower of the Two Sisters, m the direction 
of the Orontes. 

97. castello : the citadel of Antioch. It stood on the middle 
spur of Mt. Casius, to the south of the city : in medio collis 
castellum aliud, quod lingua Graeca Colax (Gr. mXaE) vocatur 
(R. of Agiles) ; castrum, quod in rupe celsa est siium (F. of 
Chartres). Bohemund planted his standard on the opposite 
hill, which was lower than the height on which the citadel 
was built. The castrum in which the flying Turks took refuge 
was this citadel. 

106. Cassianus \Yagi Sian ; Bagui-Syan (Ibn el-Athir), 
Jaghi-Seian (Abulfeda), Garsion (Chans. d'Ant.) : for other 
forms of this name cf. Hagenmeyer, G. F. xx. 10, note 66] : 
Abulfeda and W. of Tyre (Lib, IV, c. xi) say that he w’as 
a Turk of the family of Alp Arslan (Belfetoh, W. of Tyre). The 
great Sultan Malik Shah, his kinsman, is said to have placed

him in charge of Antioch in 1086 (Matth. of Edessa). He was 
a very powerful prince, described by R. of Caen as second 
only to the Sultan of Persia. (Cf. von Sybel, op. cit., c. viii ; 
Le Prevost, Ord. Vit. hi, 541.) 

109. Tancredi terram : Hagenmeyer understands this to 
refer to the Montanea Tancredi on the west and south-west 
of Antioch (cf. c. xiv). Le Prevost (Ord. Vit. hi. 541) explains 
it as that part of Chicia w-hich Tancred had already conquered, 
including the towns of Mamistra, Alexandretta, Laodicea, &c. 

no. casale: a village. Cf. Joinville, Hist, de St. Louis Ixii,

Albert of Aix, R. iv, p. 407 ; Lib. iv, c. xxvi). 

1 17. hizanteis: The bezant or byzant was a gold coin, 
which took its name from Byzantium or Constantinople, where 
it was first struck. Originally it seems to have equalled the 
Roman solidus or aureus, but later it varied in value from 
about twenty English shillings to ten shillings or less. There 
were also silver bezants, and Ducange says that the Sultans 
of Iconium struck ‘ Saracen ' bezants. The term was not used 
by the Greeks themselves. (Murray, Oxford Diet. ; Ducange, 
G/oss. ; Hagenmeyer, G.F. xvih. 10, note 60.) Cf. W. of 
Malmesbury, G.R. Lib. iv, § 354, R.S. ii, p. 410. Imperatori

CHAPTER XXI, Page 46 

I. Curbaram : the emir of Mosul, Kerboga, Kerbogha, 
Kerbuga or Kurbugha, called Kiwam ed-daula, Pillar of the 
Kngdom. His name is variously given by the western 
chroniclers as Curbaram, Curharan, Corbalan or Corhaan 
(Tudebod), Corbaga or Corbaras (R. of Agiles), Corbagath 
(F. of Chartres), Corhanas or Curbanas {Hist, belli sacri), 
Corbarans d'Oliferne {Chans. d’Antioche), &c. As an explana- 
tion of Oliferne, Paulin Paris suggests either Mesopotamia, 
a region to which this name is given in the chansons de geste, 
or Aleppo. Hagenme^^'er tentatively connects it with Botrun 
(Offrun in W. of Tyre). As Emir of Mosul Kerboga was one 
of the greatest vassals of the Persian Sultan. F. of Chartres 
describes him as dux et satrapa regis Persarum ; Albert of Aix 
as secundtis a rege. 

1-2. Soldani Persiae : Barkiarok, Barkiyaroq, the Persian 
Sultan who ruled at Baghdad from 1092 to 1102. He was 
a Seljuk Turk, the eldest son of Malik Shah. Soldan or Sultan 
is an Arabic word, meaning King, sovereign, power, dominion, 
not, as Ordericus Vitahs explains it, quasi solus dominus, quia

billah reigned from 1094 to 1118. 

II, itey longae viae : Kerboga seems to have spent some 
time in besieging Edessa on his way to relieve Antioch. 

11— 12. Hievosolymitanus Ammiyalius : Mo’in ed Daiila 
Sokman, son of Ortok. When in 1095 his brother, the emir of 
Jerusalem, was put into fetters by Dekak, emir of Damascus, 
ed Daula Sokman intervened and took possession of Jerusalem. 
He had allied with Ridwan of Aleppo, Dekak’s brother, 
against the Franks at Harenc in February 1098, and he now 
responded to Yagi Sian’s appeal for help, though they had 
formerly been enemies. 

13. Re^^ Damasci : Dekak, emir of Damascus. He was the 
brother of Ridwan, emir of Aleppo, and the son of the Sultan 
Tutusch. His stepfather and A tdheg or minister was Tughtigin, 
the Doldequinus of William of Tyre. 

16. Cuytos : Kurdistan takes its name from the Kurds, ^ an 
Aryan people, which gave birth to Saladin. ' From time 
immemorial the Kurds have led the same wild pastoral life 
in the mountain tracts between Persia and Asia Minor’. 
(Stanley Lane-Poole, Salad%n (Heroes of the Nations), p. 4.) 

23. collegium : exeycitum, army. 

24. Sensadolus : Shems ed daula, son of Yagi Sian. With 
his brother he was sent to the Mohammedan princes to appeal 
for help against the Franks. He went to Damascus and 
probably to Emesa and Arabia, while his brother, Mohammed 
Asfar, appealed to Kerboga and the eastern emirs. 

28. oppido : this oppidum was the citadel of Antioch. 

31. pair alley e : patvaye, to bring to pass, accomplish, 

36. pyoficuo : pyoficuum, i. e. profit, gain. 

48. tuyyim : the tower at the east end of the Iron Bridge. 

50-1, maioye hello : the battle of June 28, 1098, with 


Kerboga. 

52-3. duo flumina : the Orontes and its tributary the 
Karasu or Japhta, which flows into it to the east of Antioch, 
between the city and the Iron Bridge (Hagenmeyer, G.F. 
xxi. 5, note 36). ^ ^ ^ a, 

54. ayyiyyiiyaliuyn * the emir Ahmed ibn Meruan (Kamal 
ad-din). Fulcher of Chartres (R. iii. 347) calls him Maroane. 
He had subsequently to surrender the citadel to the Crusaders. 



124 NOTES 

He eventually became a Christian (Hagenmeyer, G.F, xxii. i, 
note 4 ; xxix. ii). 

59-63. adimc . . . possum . . . pnusqtiam . . . stinmlo : The text 
of Bongars now becomes somewhat turgid and long-winded, 
and the other MSS. make ' cuts ' in the interest both of 
brevity and of sense. The above passages, which are omitted 
in the Recueil edition and in all the MSS. except G {Bongars), 
are merely redundant. In later cases the text seems to be 
actually corrupt. 

78. nomina : this reading is also found in Tudebod and in 
the Historia belli sacri. All the extant MSS. and the Recueil 
edition have omnia. 

79. Amazonia flumina : the Amazons, the warlike women 
whose story was familiar to all medieval readers of Orosius, 
were said to dwell on the river Thermodon, in north-eastern 
Asia Minor, in the province of Pontus. 

82. Scribe . . . chartas : Comte Riant regards the letter 
of Kerboga to the Caliph as a clumsy imitation of genuine 
Mohammedan letters which had fallen into the hands of the 
Crusaders, but he does not reject its substance as impossible. 
Hagenmeyer treats it as pure fiction, on a par with the conversa- 
tions between Kerboga and his mother. The construction of 
the letter is suspiciously awkward. It introduces phrases 
which the Anonymous has used elsewhere in other connexions, 
such as the very improbable oath per Machomet et per omnia 
Deorum nomina (cf. cc. xxii, xxxix), or the description of the 
Christian kinsmen of the Turks, who were driven from Romania 
and Syria and ‘ the royal city Antioch (cf. c. xi). In con- 
clusion, Kerboga boasts of his resolve to win, not only the 
Asiatic lands and Bulgaria, but, an unexpected addition, 
Apulia, the home-land of the Anon3mious, a touch which 
betrays the probable source of the letter. Such fictitious 
letters and speeches were quite in the taste of the time, and 
were, indeed, a recognized form of literary expression, in which 
boys were trained by school exercises. 

90. patrare : here meaning generare. 

94. lieu ! certare : the passage qualiter . . . purissimum is 
only found in Bongars, Tudebod, and the Historia belli sacri. 
The text in Bongars is evidently corrupt, and Hagenmeyer is 
probably justified in following Tudebod and the Hist, belli 
sacri in reading certare for certate, colata for color ata, and ceu 
for seu, readings which are adopted in this edition. It may 
have been this obscurity which caused most of the copyists 
to omit the whole passage, but the words certare, colata, ceu, 
may also have been read as certate, colorata, seu, by Bongars 
himself, or by his printer. There is other evidence that he had 
some difficulty in deciphering his MSS. (c. ix). In connexion 



CHAPTER XXI 


125 

with the word colata, Hagenmeyer calls attention to Malachi, 
iii. 3 : et piirgabit filws Levi et colabit eos quasi aurtmi et quasi 
argentum {G.F. xxi. 7, note 60). 

104. Indiam : Bongars has ludaeam and the editors of 
the Recueil accept this without question. Hagenmeyer 
prefers the reading Indiam inTudebod {Codd. A, C, D) and in 
the Hist, belli sacri. This agrees with the parallel passage in 
c. xxi, where the Anonymous also speaks of the past conquests 
of the Christians in Rum and Syria, and of their desire to 
extend their boundaries ' beyond the confines of Chorasan ’ 
and to wipe out the Turkish name ‘ beyond the Amazonian 
rivers \ Upper {superior) India corresponds better than 
Upper Judaea with this description and with the geographical 
terminology of the Anonymous, while the change from Indiam 
to ludaeam or ludeam would be easily made by a scribe. Cf. 
Chans, d' Ant., Chant vii. x : " li empeneres d’Indesuperiour 
and the comment of P. Paris (li, p. 149, note i) : ' UInde 
siiperiour fut bientot apres c61ebre en Occident, comme 
empire du Prestre-Jean For the reading ludaeam, however, 
it may be urged that it is found, not only in Bongars, but in 
two MSS. {B and E) of Tudebod. 

CHAPTER XXII. Page 50 

1. Mater vero eiusdem Curbaram : ' Calabre ’ or ' Kalabra ^ 
{Rom. de Godefr. de Bouillon), mother of Kerboga, is not 
mentioned by the eastern chroniclers, but in the western 
romances and the chronicles which drew from them, she 
appears as a wise old sorceress, full of years and of occult 
lore : ‘ De la loi Paienie fu moult sage letree " {Chans. d'Ant. 
ch. I. xxviii). * Vielle fu etmousue (blear-eyed) et des ars bien 
sachant ‘ Del soleil, de la lime et d’estoile tournant ’ (Ibid., 
ch. V. xxxviii. An elaborate and fantastic tale grew out of 
the modest fancies of the Anonymous and Tudebod. The 
Chanson d' AntiochemB^^s * Calabre', the daughter of ' Rubiant 

' lord of the two Gates of the world The Roman de Godefr oi 
says that she was the sister of both Yagi Sian and Ortok 
{Corbados) of Jerusalem. (Cf. B. of DoL, Guib. of Nogent, 
Robert the Monk.) 

2. statim : denuo in the MSS. and in the Recueil. The Chans, 
d' Ant. mentions more than one visit of Kerboga's mother to 
her son. She appears first in the camp before Civitot (Ch. i. 
xxvii) and again later, when Kerboga is preparing to attack 
the Franks at Antioch (Ch. v. xxxviii (probably an interpola- 
tion), Ch. VII. vii seq,).

68-9. in nostra pagina et in gentilium vohmvinihiis : nostra 
pagina refers to the Koran, though it contains no such pro- 
phecies. The volimiina gentilium are the non-Mohammedan 
books, the prophetic writings of the Scriptures and perhaps 
also the Sibylline Oracles, Apocalyptic writings composed by 
Jews, and later by Christians of the second and third centuries 
A. D., in imitation of the ancient Sibylhne Books, to win the 
heathen to their faith. Liutprand, who visited Constantinople 
in A. D. 968, writes in iiis Relatio de legatione Const., c. 38 : 
Hahent Graeci et Sarraceni libros, quos opda^is, sive visiones 
Danielis vocant, ego autetn Sibyllinos ; in quihus scriptum

eo imperitante, iempora ; pax an simuUas, secimdae Sara- 
cenorum res an advcrsae. Many prophecies, early and later, 
of the eternal dominion of the Roman Empire and of the 
subjection of the heathen to Christian rulers were probably 
known to the Anonymous (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxii. 8, notes 
33 » 34; 35;' Enc. Brit, ed. n. Sibylline Oracles', H.A. L. 
Fisher, The Medieval Empire, I, c. i). Cf. Godfrey of Viterbo :

the^ name Grentemaisml, Grantmesnil, Granduna ; Grandts 
mainil (R. of Agiles), Grande masneda [Hist, belli sacri), 
Grente mesml [Chans, d Ant.), is derived from Grandmesml in 
Normandy, near Lisieux. These two brothers were the 
younger sons of Hugh, baron, sheriff of Leicestershire, &c., 
an Anglo-Norman feudatory who with his brother Robert was 
the second founder and restorer of the Norman monastery of 
St. Evroul. William of Grantmesnil married Robert Guiscard’s 
daughter Mabel ; thus he was Bohemund's brother-in-law. 
In the Chans. d'Ant. (Ch. hi. xxii) Baldwin puts him in charge 
of Tarsus in Cilicia. He covered himself with shame by his 
flight from Antioch, with Alberic, and, according to Tudebod 
and other sources, with another brother, Ivo or Ives. Alberic 
and Ivo had taken part in the rebellion of Robert of Normandy 
against his father in 1077. Ivo inherited the family estates 
in England. He seems to have died on pilgrimage (Hagen- 
meyer [op. cit.), Le Prevost [op. cit.), Chans. d'Ant., Diet. 
Nat. Biog. (Hugh), xxviii. 159). 

II. Wido Trursellus ITrosselhts, Trussellus, Guido Ruheus

He is said to have held the office of seneschal of France and 
to have forfeited it by his flight from Antioch [Rec. Hist, des 
Crois., Hist. occ. hi. 650, note i ; iv. 64, note e ; 563, note c). 
Alb. of Aix says that he took part in the Crusade of iioi. 

11— 12. LamherHis JPauper : Le Prevost (Ord. Vit. hi. 545,

mont near Lidge, who is said to have returned to Europe 
with Peter the Hermit and to have been one of the founders 
of the house of Augustinian canons at Neumoustier, near 
Huy, in the Lidge diocese, where the Hermit is supposed, on 
somewhat doubtful authority, to have ended Ms days. Paulin 
Paris doubts tMs identification, and Hagenmeyer shows the 
inadequacy of the evidence both for the identification and for 
the whole story of the connexion of the Hermit with the 
Count of Clermont, though he is inclined to tMnk that Peter 
may have ended as an inmate of Neumoustier (Hagenmeyer,

2. casiellum : the citadel. 

3. qnidam sacerdos : Tudebod calls him Stephanns, R. of 
Agiles : Stephanns, cognomine Valenti, Stephanus Valentinus. 
He is said by R. of Agiles to have seen Adhemar of Le Puy in 
a vision, during the siege of Area. 

5. ecclesia S. Mariae : this church, which is described by 
Fulcher of Chartres as round., forma rotunda, is said to have been 
built by Justinian. During the Turkish rule in Antioch, it was 
the only church which remained to the Christians. 

9. integra crux : a cross complete in all its parts. R. of Agiles 
gives these visions in great detail. 

27, domum meam ; the church of St. Peter, the largest and 
most important Christian church in Antioch stood on a hill, 
in the southern quarter. The Turks turned it into a mosque. 
Cf. R. of Agiles (R iii. 258, D) : quam antea Sarraceni Mahu 
mariam fecerunt. B. of Dol says that Urban II specially 
mentioned this church in his address at Clermont. When the 
Franks took the city the church of St. Peter was rededicated 
to Christian worship. 

33. Congregati sunt : the editors of the Recueil refer to 
Processionale Rothomagense, sub rithrica : In tempore belh. 
Cf. R. of Agiles (R iii. 256), where Christ bids Stephen Valen- 
tinus tell the bishop of Le Puy that when the people go into 
battle they^ are to say : Congregati sunt inimict nostri, et 
gloriantur in virtute sua ; contere fortitudinem illorum, Domine, 
et disperge illos : ut cognoscant quia non est alius qui ptignet 
pro nobis, nisi tu Deus noster. (Cf. Num. x. 35 ; Ps. Ixviii. 2, 
cxliv. 6 ; I Reg. viii. 60 ; Ecclus. xxxvi. 5 ; Exod. xiv. 14, 
25 ; Deut. i. 30 ; Jos. x. 14, xxiii. 3.) The versus is the 
doxology : Gloria Patri, &c. 

45. Tancredtis , . . iurauit'. R. of Agiles makes the princes 
swear : quod de Antiochianon fugerent neque egrederentur nisi de 
communi consiho omnium. He says that the people were much 
comforted by this oath, for they thought that the princes 
wanted to flly to the port.

^ 2. Petrus : R. of Agiles, the fullest authority for the Inven- 
tion of the Holy Lance, of which he was an eye-witness, gives 
this visionary the name of Peter Bartholomew {Petrus Bartholo- 
meus). Ord. Vit. and others call him Abraham. He was a 
Provencal, not a priest, but the servant of a wealthier pilgrim. 
R. of Agiles describes him as pauper quidam rusticus, a peasant, 
illiterate and ignorant. He was afraid at first to reveal his 
visions lest it should be supposed that he was inventing them 
to get food from the bishop of Le Puy and the Count of 
Toulouse. For his ordeal and death, cf. R. of Agiles (R iii. 168 
seq.) and F. of Chartres. 

7. lanceam Saluatoris nostri : lancea dominica^ qua 
Salvatoris nostri latus Longini manibus perforatum fuit (Ep. 
prin. ad Urban : F. of Chartres, R iii. 351). There was an early 
tradition that the lance preserved in St. Peter’s Church was 
the lance of St. Mercurius, not the Holy Lance of Longinus (cf . 
Rohricht, Gesch. des ersten Kreuzz., 141, note i ; Romania, ix. 
34, note I ; xix. 564, note i). [Cf. Introd., pp. xv, xxviii.]

12. Hugo li Forcenez : Bongars has Hugo Cli Forcenez, 
probably a printer’s or copyist’s error, but significant as 
showing that his MSS. may have been corrupt, and that his 
printed text is not infallible. Hagenmeyer and the Recueil use 
the form adopted in the text of this edition. MS. C reads 
hugo visanus. Hagenmeyer gives the reading insamis from 
MS. A (cf. p. 145). Mr. W. H. Stevenson has pointed out to me 
that the O.Fr. participle forsenes means insane, out of one’s 
senses. Cf. mod. Fr. forcene. Tudebod gives the name as lo 
Forsenet, lo Forsennet, the Hist, belli sacri as Forsonea. The 
Chans, d^ Ant. and Rob. the Monk mention the incident, but 
omit Hugh’s name. He was apparently an Italian, a follower of 
Godfrey of Monte Scabioso. Thus it falls to the Italian 
Anonymous to preserve the name of a brave compatriot. This 
episode does not seem to be identical, as von Sybel thought, 
with the attack on a tower by thirty Turks, described by R. of 
Agiles (Riii. 258, E). (Cf. Hagenmeyer, < 9 . F. xxvi, i, notes 8, 9.)

Dog Gate (Hagenmeyer, G.F, xxvi. 2, note 15). The Bridge 
Gate was opposite Machumana, the fort of R. of Toulouse. 

21 . poYtam duds Godefridi : the ' Duke’s Gate ’ in the north 
wall, east of the Bridge Gate, and between the Bridge Gate and 
the Dog Gate. 

25-6. pro . . . ecclesiis : Bongars, and the Recueil following 
Bongars and E, read pro aliis ecclesiis. Hagenmeyer inserts 
ecclesia Sancti Petri et Sanctae Mariae between pro and aliis, 
from MSS. A {San Lorenzo del Escorial, late 12th cent.) and 
B (Bibl. Nat. Madrid, late 13th cent, to early 14th cent.). This 
emendation has been adopted in the text, as it seems necessary 
to explain the alhs ecclesiis in the passage. Tudebod {codd. 
B, E) has : timens quod ecclesia Sancti Petri, et ecclesia Sanctae 
Mariae arderent. (Cf. Hist, belli sacri, Rob. the Monk., Guib. of 
Nogent, ad loc ) MS. C of the Gesta omits the whole passage 
from Boamundus to ecclesiis. 

33-4. habebat aquam : aquam, which is needed to com- 
plete the sense, is here inserted from Tudebod, followed by 
Hagenmeyer. 

36. machinas : fecerunt . . . contra Jiostes niurum calceum 
et propugnacula ; etmunierunt haec muUis petrariis (R. of Agiles 
R iii. 259, D). 

43. Boamundi portam : the Gate of St. Paul, or East Gate 
(cf. cc. xii, xvii), 

49—50. Sanctae Christianitatis Bongars’ text here reads 
Dei et sanctae Trinitatis. The emendation Sanctae Christiam- 
tatis appears to be justified. Tudebod, in the corresponding 
passage, has sanctae Chrisitanitatis inimicis, and in c. x the 
Anonymous calls the Turks inimici Dei et sanctae Christianitatis . 
Hagenmeyer adopts this reading, which is also found in the 
Hist, belli sacri, but he omits sanctae {G.F. xxxvi, 4, note 29). 

58. cardtii : thistles. 

CHAPTER XXVII. Page 60 

1. Imprudens . . . Stephanus : for Stephen, Count of Blois 
and Chartres, cf. c. viii. The epithet imprudens is applied by 
William of Malmesbury to his son. King Stephen of England. 
He returned to the Holy Land in noi and was killed fighting 
against the Saracens in 1102. The western chroniclers who 
wrote after he had retrieved his reputation by a glorious 
death judge him less unfavourably than his immediate con- 
temporaries. 

3. ductor nosirorum : caput no sir orum (Tud.) : quem . . ,pro 



CHAPTER XXVII 131 

dictatove ahi principes elegemnt {R. of Agiles). In Stephen’s 
second letter to his wife he writes ; Nam cuncti principes nostri 
communi consilio totius exercitus me dominum suum atque 
omnium suorum aciuum provisorem atque gubernatorem, efiam 
me nolenU usque ad tempus constituerunt. 

5 . A lexandreta : A lexandriola (R. of Caen) , A lexandria minor 
(Aib. of Aix, W. of Tyre), Iscanderum (Abulfeda), lies north 
of Antioch near the bay of the same name. It had been fortified 
and IS therefore called castrum by the Anonymous. Alb. of Aix 
says that Tancred destroyed its walls and gates in his first 
Cilician expedition. 

10 pyoximam montaneam : one of the heights of the 
Amanus range (Hagenmeyer, G. F. xxvii. i, note 7). 

15. PUlomenam : Alb. of Aix says that Stephen took ship 
from Alexandretta and landed on a Greek island. Here he 
heard that Alexius and his army had arrived at Finiminis, where 
he joined them. Philomena is Philomelium, now Akshehr, 
in Phrygia, between Dorylaeum and Iconium. R. of Caen puts 
the meeting at Cuthai, the modern Kiuthahia, south-west of 
Dorylaeum. For the interview cf. Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxvii, 
notes j Chalandon, Alex. Comnhie, p. 203 ; von Sybel, op. 

21. duds : here in MSS. A, C, H is inserted a passage (cf, 
p. 61, foot-notes) describing how one of the * rope-dancers 
William de Archis (cf. note, c. xxiii. 16), told the Emperor that 
Bohemund had sworn that if Alexius came to Antioch he 
should lose his head. From this Hagenmeyer infers the com- 
paratively late date of this group of MSS. The passage, he 
argues, belongs to a period when the hostility between Bohe- 
mund and Alexius had become marked, from 1105 to 1108, or 
later. William de Archis is spoken of as having been a knight, 
but as being now a monk, (Hagenmeyer, G. F. xxvii. 2, note 
13 ; Einl. § 7.) 

22. Widonem Jratrem Boamundi : Wido, Gtndo, or Gt#y was 
Bohemund's step-brother, son of Robert Guiscard and of his 
second wife Sigelgaita. In the romances he plays a more pro- 
minent part than in sober history, (Cf. Chans. d'Ant and 
Cheval. au Cygne.) 

58. semicano : semicanus, half-grey, grizzled. 

65. cum venerint Turd : * craignant, et c’est la qu’apparait 
son entiere bonne foi en cette circonstance, que les Turks ne 
missent a profit leur victorie pour penetrer en Asie Mineure, 
Comndne ordonna de ravager tout le pays . . . afin que I’ennemi 
ne trouvat aucune ressource s’il penetrait sur ie territoire 
grec ’ (Chalandon, op, dt., p. 203). Aima Comnena says that 
the Emperor feared the advance of the Turks on Constantinople, 
and that a Turkish army under the son of the Sultan of Persia 
was actually marching against the Greek troops.

NOTES 


CHAPTER XXVIII. Page 63 

1-3. Nos . perueninms : the Anonymous was apparently 
in the church of St. Peter at the time of the Invention of the 
Holy Lance, though he was not one of the thirteen diggers of 
whom he speaks. 

4-3. tredecim homines : R. of Agiles and Tudebod say that 
there were twelve men. R. of Agiles specially mentions the 
presence of the Bishop of Orange {Auras teens is), Count 
Raymond of Toulouse and his chaplain, Pontius de Baladuno, 
and Faraldus de Tornaiz. 

12- securo eloquio : bold, decided speech. 

16. Herluinum : dragomandiis Petri (Tudebod). He knew 
two languages, Arabic and Pro ven9al, according to Hagenmeyer, 
and acted as interpreter for Peter the Hermit on the mission to 
Kerboga which had been decided on in the Council of the 
Princes. 

26-8. ejffici Christiani . . . Christianos afficiatis ? Hagen- 
meyer (G. F. xxviii. 3, note 16), takes afficere in this passage to 
mean ' to benefit and regards it as intended to heighten the 
ironic effect of the question. It seems more likely that effici and 
afficiatis are in apposition, and that afficere is used in the sense 
of ' to injure \ 

42. effeminatis gentihus : the Greeks were regarded as 
effeminate by the western peoples as well as by the Turks. 
W. of Tyre (xv. 3), speaks of them as effeniinati Graecorum 
populi (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxviii. 4, note 23). 

CHAPTER XXIX. Page 65 

^5-6. sex acies : this chapter describes the great battle with 
Kerboga of June 28, 1098. The number of the divisions, acies, 
or turmae, their order, leaders, <&c., vary considerably in the 
different chronicles ; though there is substantial agreement, 
they differ in details. The Anonymous and his plagiarists give 
a vivid picture of the action, which should be compared with 
the corresponding passages of R. of Agiles. Of modern 
writers, Sir Charles Oman (Art of War, vol. i, Bk. v, c. iii, p. 282 
seq., Plates vii, viii) has given a valuable account of the battle 
from the military point of view, von Sybel and Rohricht (opp, 
ctt.) may also be consulted. Hagenmeyer has very full notes 
on this subject. 

11. porians , ..lanceam: Raymond of Agiles actually bore the 
Holy Lance. V idi ego haec quae loquor, he writes, et Dominicam 
lanceam ibiferebam, Ordericus Vitalis makes Peter Bartholo- 
mew the Lance-bearer, 

12. cum exerciiu Raimundi comitis : Raymond of Toulouse 
himself remained at Antioch with 200 men, to watch the 



CHAPTER XXIX 133 

Turkish garrison of the citadel, as he was too ill [valde infivma- 
hatuY, R. of Agiles) for more active service. 

^ 3 "* 4 - portmi quae est ante Machomariam : the Bridge Gate. 
This passage shows that the Anonymous was a layman and a 
soldier. (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxix. 2, note 13.) 

29. suo aMmivaho [amir alio ^ • the name of this emir is 

not mentioned by the Anonymous, but Hagenmeyer is inclined 
to identify him with Gelis AYslan^ GeYsaslan in Fulcher’s list 
of emirs (F . of Chartres, R iii. 347), with the Roseleon mentioned 
by Albert of Aix, and with the Rouge-Lion {Rouges lions) of the 
Chans. d'Ant (ii._36i). Rouge-Lion corresponds to the Turkish 
name Kizil- Arslan (red lion), which is probably represented by 
Fulcher s Gelis Arslan. In Chans, d Ant, Rouge-Lion plays 
at chess with Kerboga just before the battle. This incident, 
without the name of Kerboga’s partner, is found in R. of Agiles, 
in F. of Chartres, and in R. of Caen, (Introd. p. xxix, note i). 
G J. 3--4 • montaneam : the range lying to the north of the Bridge 

39. Reinaldus : W. of Tyre, following Albert of Aix, con- 
nects this Reinaldus with a certain Reinaldus of Tul (Toul), 
a follower of G. of Bouillon, who had taken part in the siege of 
Nicaea, and in Baldwin’s expedition to Tarsus. 

50—2. Sancti Georgius^ Mercurius et Demetrius : for 
St. George cf. cc. ii, xxxvi, R. of Agiles (R iii. 290) mentions 
a later appearance of St. George to the priest Desiderius. He 
is also said to have appeared, with SS. Demetrius and Theodore 
at the battle of Dorylaeum. St Mercurius, another soldier 
saint, was, if his legend may be believed, a Scythian, and 
the leader of the army of the Emperor Decius in the Persian 
war. He refused to worship false gods and was tortuied, but 
an angel healed him. He was eventually put to death as a 
Christian. St. Demetrius, a native of Thessalonica and pro- 
consul of Achaia, was martyred under the Emperor Maxi- 
minianus- The element of the marvellous enters also into his 
legend. The Chans, d Ant. and Robert the Monk add to these 
three St. Maurice, the Christian hero of the Theban legion, 

' qu’on tint por bon guerrier ’ {Chans. dAnt, Chh. viii, li). 

54-5. miserunt ignem in herham : R. of Agiles (R iii. 260) 
mentions the firing of the dry grass, but says that it was done 
that the Franks qui gladios non fovmidabant, saltim ah igne 
corriperentur. 

57, honor dbilia spolia : onerahilia ; ‘ portable.’ 

71—2. castellum Tancredi : probably the fort at Harenc 
(cf. c. xvii). 

81—2. qui castellum custodiehat : castrum . . . admiratus 
quidam, qui in eo erat cum mille hominibus, Boamundo se 
reddidit {Ep, ad. Urban, F. of Chartres, Riii. 351 G). 

99. baptizatus est ammiralius : his conversion is mentioned

in the letter of the Princes to Urban II (cf. B. of Dol and R. 
the Monk). For this emir, cf. cc. xxi, xxii. 

102. tevram : the Hist, belli sacri says that Kerboga’s tent 
was sent by sea to the church of St. Nicholas, at Bari, ut 
laetaretur omnis Christiana plehs de tviumpho, quern deditpopulo 
suo Dominus super paganorum gentem. (Hagenmeyer, G.F. 
xxix. 12, note 56. 

CHAPTER XXX. Page 69 

1-2, [Deo . , . grates) : Bongars puts the second bracket after 
referimus, instead of after grates : another instance of careless 
printing. 

II. Hugonem Magnum : he was charged to offer the 
Emperor the lordship of Antioch if he would fulfil his engage- 
ments to the Crusaders, make war on the Turks, and take the 
field in person (von Sybel. op. cit., p. 376). With Hugh went 
Baldwin of Hainault (de Monte, cf. cc. ii, x). 

13. nec postea rediit : Hugh eventually returned to France, 
but Baldwin of Hainault appears to have been either killed or 
taken prisoner in a skirmish with the Turks near Nicaea, on his 
way to Constantinople. 

18. Inuentum est in concilio : Bongars has Inuentum in : 
the est has been supplied from ER and Ha. 

29. Raimundus Ptlekis : Albert of Aix makes this Provencal 
Raymond one of the besiegers of Nicaea and a notable leader 
in the battle with Kerboga. Cf. Chans. d'Ant. ii. 358. R. of 
Agiles calls him miles nobilissinius et fortis and notes his 
presence at the ordeal of Peter Bartholomew, when he rescued 
Peter from the excited populace (R iii. 284). Cf. c. xxxvii (cf. 
Vaissete, Hist, du Languedoc, ii). 

33. {Talamania : Tell-mannas, inhabited by Christian 
Syrians [Rec., Hist. occ. iv. 451). 

46. Mavra : Ma'arat en Nu^man, on the caravan route 
from Aleppo to Emesa, two days’ journey south of Aleppo. 
Cf. notes, c. xxxiii (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxx. 7, note 25). 

56. castrum : Tell-mannas. 

58-60. viam carpers . . . victoria . . . ministrahat : possible 
echoes of Virgil (cf. Aen. vi. 629, xi. 71, Georg, iii. 215 seq. * 
Hagenmeyer, G.F., Einleit, p. 38). 

62. congregatifuerant'. Tudebodadds! quidam optimus miles 
Arnaldus scilicet Tudebovis interfectus est. This may have 
been his brother. (Cl note c. xxiii. 9. Introd. p. xi. note 2). 

67-8. Podiensis episcopus : he died, possibly of a pestilence 
which was raging in Antioch, on August i, 1098, and was 
buned in the Church of St. Peter, according to Albert of Aix 
and Guib. of Nogent, on the spot where the Holy Lance had 
been found. R. of Caen gives his epitaph (c. 95). But in life 



CHAPTER XXX 


135 

he had doubted the genuineness of the Holy Lance, and 
Raymond of Agiles (R iii. 278) relates how he appeared after 
death to Peter Bartholomew and told him that for this 
scepticism he had suffered scourging and burning in hell. 
When Ms unifying influence was withdrawn, the dissensions 
among the princes became painfully apparent. For Ms rela- 
tions with the future patriarch Arnulf cf. c. xxxix (cf. note, 
c. iii. 2-3). 

CHAPTER XXXI. Page 72 

4. Alhara {Albaria (c. xxxiii) ; Barra (R. of Agiles, R iii. 
266)] : the modern Kefr el Bara, two days’ journey to the south- 
east of Antioch, in the mountainous region east of the Orontes. 

12. oracuJa : here oracuhtm stands for a temple, a place in 
which to pray. 

13. sapientissimum virum : Peter of Narbonne was chosen 
to be bishop of Antioch. Bishop Adhemar, in the narrative of 
Raymond of Agiles, appeared to Peter Bartholomew and told 
him that the Count of Toulouse must choose a bishop in his 
place. This was done at Barra (Albara). The Count took 
counsel with the princes and clergy and then called the people 
together and Peter of Narbonne was chosen. The Count 
granted him half the city of Antioch and its territory (R. of 
Agiles, R iii. 301). The bishop accompanied the Crusading 
host to Jerusalem (cf. c. xxxviii). 

17-18. regressi sunt . . . maiores : R. of Agiles says that after 
the death of Adhemar, Boamundus in Romaniam est regressus, et 
dux Lotharingiae versus Roais profectus est. By All Saints Day 
1098 they were once more gathered together in Antioch. 

26. peierare : the Count was afraid of perjuring Mmself by 
breaking his oath to the Emperor. 

34. cathedra : here the special place in the Church in wMch 
stood the chair or throne of St. Peter, who was reputed to have 
been bishop of Antioch (Hagenmeyer, G.F, xxi. 4, note 17). 
The bishops and magnates held their meeting in the church, a 
common medieval practice. 

37—9. Priusquam . . . volueriti Hagenmeyer explains this 
to mean : ‘ if we wait till Bohemund is willing to come with us, 
we shall never get to Jerusalem.’ Raymond of Agiles gives an 
interesting account of the discussion in the church of St. Peter 
and of the impatience of the ' people ’ (populus) at the delay 
caused by the selfishness and ambition of the leaders. Nos 
autem, they said, Christo pro quo v animus duce, iter nostrum 
aggrediamur (R iii. 267). 

39. pares : the use of tMs word for the senior as should be 
noted. The Count of Toulouse would submit to the judgement 
of his peers, saving Ms fealty to the Emperor. 

45-6. castrum de alia montanea: wMle Bohemund fortified 



NOTES 


136 

the citadel, his rival Raymond of Toulouse fortified the palace 
of Yagi Sian and the tower over the Bridge Gate. The question 
of the lordship of Antioch was in suspense, and, as Raymond of 
Agiles says, ‘ discordant peace ' was made between Bohemund 
and the Count. 

48-9. portam pontis : here Hagenmeyer and the Recueil 
insert : qui est ex parte PorUis Sancti Simeonis. Ct foot-note 
p. 74, 49. 


CHAPTER XXXII. Page 74 

Margin : Situs urbis Antioohiae, This marginal note in 
Bongars’ text is probably due to a copyist rather than to the 
Anonymous himself. Hagenmeyer thinks that this whole 
chapter was inserted, out of its due place, when the Anonymous 
revised his book late in the year 1099 (G.P., Einleit, p. 20 ; 
cf. notes, c. xii). 

2-3. qtiatuor montaneae : spurs of the Mt. Casius range. 
Abulfeda says that the city is built on seven hills. 

7, monasteria : Hagenmeyer suggests that among the 360 
* monasteries ' were counted cells and mountain hermitages. 
Other writers mention 40 or 60 monasteries. 

9-10. duohus muris : for Justinian’s wonderful walls, with 
their towers and defences, cf. c. xx, note 7-8, p. 120, and 
references. There are good descriptions in Oman, Art of War, 
and in Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxii. 2, notes, 9, 10. As the fortifica- 
tions ' may have enclosed an area of some four square miles ’ 
(Archer and Kingsford, Crusades, p. 65), and as ' no one could 
walk for a quarter of a mile along the enceinte without passing 
through six or seven towers ’ (Oman, op. cit.), there was 
practically a chain of small castles encircling the city. 

15. Farfar : the Orontes. 

18. septuaginta quinque reges ; Tudebod attempts to give 
their names. Seleucus Nicator foun.ded the city about 300 b.c. 
He is said to have called it after his father Antiochus. 

20~i, octo menses et vnum diem : October 21, 1097 June 
3, 1098. Perhaps the month is reckoned as twenty-eight days, 
or four weeks, as Hagenmeyer suggests. 

22. ires hebdomadas : Tudebod says that Kerboga besieged 
the city for twenty-six days. 

CHAPTER XXXIII. Page 75 

4. Rugia [Roia (R. of Agiles), Rubea (Tudebod)] : Riha, It 
lies between Antioch and Marra, in the mountains to the east 
of the Orontes (cf. c. xi). 

10. comites : the Counts of Toulouse and Flanders (R. of 
Agiles) ; Albert of Aix adds Godfrey and Eustace of Boulogne 
and Robert of Normandy. 



CHAPTER XXXIII 137 

13. scalae : sectmda die si quatuor scalas plus hahtiis- 
semus, capta esset civtias {R. of Agiles), 

17. li^netim casfrum : Robert the Monk (Lib. VIII, c. ii) des- 
cribes this siege-tower very carefully. It had threestoreys : in the 
two upper ones were soldiers fully equipped and armed ; in 
the lowest one were armed men who worked the wheels on which 
the to^wer ran. Others had to bring up a shelter, penthouse, or 
testudo, and to fill in the fosse or ditch, that the tower might be 
wheeled near to the wall (cf. Oman, op. cit., vol. i, Bk. iii, c. vi). 

20. Enuardus Venator : Venator quidam, nomine Emiardiis, 
qui spiritu buccinandi erat praeditus. Nam sono tumultuosae 
voces et adversaries exterrehat, et snos ad bella incitabat (R. the 
Monk, Lib. VTII, c. ii). Robert the Monk should be read for 
the siege of Marra and also R. of Agiles. 

23-4. instnmientum : apparently a mangon, funda, or 
sling, worked by torsion, rather than a halista, catapult, or 
* magnified crossbow ^ worked by tension, but the various 
terms for these machines are used almost indiscriminately 
by medieval writers (Oman, op. cit., vol. i, Bk. iii, c. vi, 
vol. ii, Bk. vii, c. iii). 

26. Graecos ignes : Ignis cum oleo et adipe mixtus (F. of 
Chartres). ' A semi-liquid substance, composed of sulphur, 
pitch, dissolved nitre, and petroleum boiled together and 
mixed \wth certain less important and more obscure sub- 
stances ’ (Oman, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 46-8). Known to the 
Byzantine Greeks from the seventh century, it played a great 
part in Crusading warfare (cf. Oman, op. cit. : Joinville, Hist, de 
St. Louis, c. xliii). 

29—30, superiori solario : the solarium or * sun-room * was 
generally an upper chamber in a house. Here the word is 
used for the top storey of the siege-tower, which was higher 
than the town wall. 

30. Wilhelmus de Monte Pislerio : cf. c. xi. Guillelmus de 
Monte Pislerio {alias Pessulano) ipse fuit cum multis aliis in 
superiori solario (R. the Monk, Lib. VIII, c. ii), 

43—4. Gulferius de Daturre [Golfertus de Turribus (R. of 
Agiles), Gulferius de la Turre (R. the Monk)] : Lord of the castle 
of Lasturs in the Limousin. His local name is given as Dasturs, 
Lasturs in the Hist, belli sacri. In the army of Raymond of 
Toulouse at Antioch, he took part in the Tell-mannas expedi- 
tion (c. xxx). Legend gives him a ' faithful lion which he 
saved from a snake. It followed him like a dog, and when, 
on his return home, the sailors refused to take it on board 
ship, it swam after its master and was drowned. (Hagenmeyer, 
G.F, xxxiii. 5, note 25; Le Provost, Ord. Vit. iii. 580 ; von 
Sybel, op. cit., 387 ; Vaissdte, Hist, du Languedoc, ii.)

2798 T 



NOTES 


138 

Reciieil and Hagenmeyer in inserting from B, C, E, &c., the 
sentence : illi antem, qui ascendebant, expediebant circa illos 
murum. It may well be original, but the passage in Bongars’ 
text is complete without it. It means ' they cleared the wall 
(from enemies) about them \ Tudebod has : Golferius vero, 
quum fuit supra murum, cep it cum illis pugnare cum lancea 
occidendo. (Cf, Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxiii, 5, note 26.) 

56-7. foderunt murum vrbis : R. of Agiles (R iii. 269, H) 
says that the Turks in the town threw at the Franks stones 
and darts, fire, logs of wood, beehives full of bees, and lime. 

78. vmim mensem et quatuor dies: December ii, 1098 to 
January 13, 1099. 

79. Oriensis episcopus : William, bishop of Orange, He 
was present at the Councils of Piacenza and Clermont, was 
sent by the Pope on a crusading mission to Genoa and then 
joined the Proven9al army. It was he who gathered the 
people together in the siege of Marra, and exhorted them to 
piety and perseverance. 

CHAPTER XXXIIII. Page 78 

17. honestare : Raymond of Toulouse ordered his knights at 
Antioch to put the palace and the tower over the Bridge Gate 
into a good state of defence. Honestare here means to equip, 
to prepare for war. 

21. Capharda : Kafartah, Kefrtah, near Marra, on the road 
from Aleppo to Hamah, had been conquered by Yagi Sian 
and his allies in 1096. It is called casirum or oppidum by the 
chroniclers, and Raymond of Toulouse had already occupied 
and garrisoned it, in the plunder-raid which he made from 
Marra early in January 1099. 

23. Rex . . . Caesar eae : the emir Ibn Moncad (Kamal ad- 
din, Ibn el-Athir). Caesarea on the Farfar, called Larissa ad 
Orontem in the old itineraries (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxiv. 5, 
note 22), is the Sheyzar, Scheizar, Chezar of the Arabs, ‘ the 
rocky fortress of Sheyzar, the ruins of which still overhang 
the Orontes (Stanley Lane-Poole, Saladin, p. 28 seq.) Osama 
(Ousama, Usama), the Arab writer, was its prince in the 
twelfth century^ (cf. Derenbourg, Ousdma ibn Mounhidh). 

49^ Kephaliam : the ancient Raphania, Rafinia (Kamal 
ad-din), between Apamea and Tripolis j oppidwrrtr extra 
Lihammi montem siUim (F. of Chartres, R iii. 479). 

54. montaneam : the Ansariya or Ansarieh Mountains 
north of Lebanon. 

vallem de Sem : Bongars' text has de Lem in this passage, 
Desem in c. xxxv. Hagenmeyer reads Desem in both cases" 
but fails to explain the form. The Recueil editors read de Sem 
and Desem, This probably represents the original reading. 



CHAPTER XXXIII 


139 

for Tudebod {codd. B, E) has vallem de Issem. Bongars' de 
Lem is an obvious scribal error. It is possible that this name 
is connected with Hisn el~Akrdd, the famous ‘ Kurds’ Castle 
known later as Crac *des Chevaliers. This fortress lies at the 
end of the El Bukeia plain, which appears to be the vallem of 
the text, where it opens out to the sea (Stanley Lane-Poole, 
op. oit., pp. 27, 246 ; Hagenmeyer, G.E. xxxiv. 9, note 36). 
It is more probable, as has been suggested to me, that de 
Sem and Desem represent the Syriac d’ sem = Arabic shem, 
Syria, Damascus. The castrum, in which ' a great multitude 
of heathen ’ had gathered, was perhaps an early castle on the 
site of Crac des Chevaliers. 

68-9. Camela ciuitate [Emesa, Emissa (W. of Tyre), Hims, 
Homs, La Chamelle (Joinville) ] : lies between Aleppo and 
Damascus. 

69. Rex . . . illiiis : Jenah ed-daula, an ally of Kerboga, who 
had been present at the blockade of Antioch by the Turks. 
F. of Chartres calls this emir GinahadoUs. 

71--2. Rex . . . Tripolis : the Kadi Abu Ali Ibn Amar (cf. 
Abulfeda) Jemal-almolk Abulhassan Ali ibn Amar (Ibn 
el-Athir). R. of Agiles attributes these embassies from the 
emirs to the taking of the castrum ; terruerat enim totam 
regionem illam castelli oppugnafio, quoniam nunquam antea ah 
aliquihtis potiiit expugnari (R iii. 275, B). The modern name 
for Tripolis is Tarabulus. It was a flourishing Mediterranean 
port, situated in a fertile plain and surrounded by the sea on 
three sides. In the wars between Fatimites and Seljuk Turks 
it had become almost independent. 

78. Archae \Arca, Arkal : cf. F. of Chartres, (R iii. 353) ; 
castrum Archas ad radicem niontis Lihani situm, quod condidit 
Aracaeus {ut legitur Gen. x. 17) Chanaan filius,nepos Noe. R of 
Agiles describes it as munitissinium et inexpugnabile viribus 
humanis. It was north of Tripolis, about four leagues distant, 
according to R. of Agiles. 

91- 2, Raimundus . . . de Tenioria : de Taurina, p. 86 ; 
R. de Torena (Tud.), who guarded the fort Machumaria ; R, 
de Taurina {Hist, belli sacrz), who went with Raymond Piletus 
on the Tellmannas expedition. He was a southern Frenchman 
from Turenne in the Limousin, and a follower of the Count 
of Toulouse (cf. Le Pr6vost, Ord. Vit. iii. 588). 

92- 3. Tortosam ciuitatem : Tortosa, the ancient Antaradus, 
the modern Tartus, a small but strongly fortified seaport 
some forty miles north of Tripolis. While the Crusaders were 
besieging Area, Tortosa was a victualling base to which 
ships from Europe could bring supplies. 

104. Maraclea : the modern Marakia, on the sea, north of 
Tortosa.

NOTES 


CHAPTER XXXV. Page 82 

2-3. Liohiam ciuitatem : Laodicea, the modern Ladikieh. 
It had an excellent harbour and easy communications with 
Cyprus, and it lay in a fertile wme-growing district. At the 
time of the First Crusade it was the only place left to the 
Greeks. During the siege of Area Genoese and Venetian ships 
brought supplies for the Franks to this port. 

5. ^ Gihellum : the ancient Gabala, now Jehelli, south of 
Laodicea, about half-way between Area and Antioch. It 
was under the Kadi xA.bu Mohamed Obeid Allah (Abulfeda, 
Ibn el-Athir.). When the army was before Sheyzar Raymond 
of Toulouse had wanted to take Gibellum, but the opposition 
of the army in general, and of Tancred in particular, led him 
to abandon the scheme (von Sybel, op. cit,, 392). 

14. vltra flumen : the Nahr Arka. Area or Arka was on its 
northern bank. 

16. contra Tripolim : Raymond of Agiles (R iii. 285, B) 
attributes the change in the submissive attitude of the emir 
of Tripolis and his refusal to pay tribute, to his knowledge of 
the quarrels among the Christian leaders. 

20. aqua . . . fluehat : the Nahr Kadisha flows near the old 
town of Tripolis. R. of Agiles here mentions an aqueduct 
which brought water into the town. 

29. Naues . . . nosirae : Greek, Venetian, Genoese, and 
English ships are known to have come to the help of the 
Crusaders. R. of Agiles has an interesting passage (c. xxxii) 
on the English ships, which had decreased in number by the 
spring of 1099 from thirty to nine or ten. 

35. Anselmus do Riboatmont [de Ribodi Monte (Hagenmeyer, 
Gesta Franc, c. xxxv, 3, note 24), Riberi Monte, Ripaniondi 
(R. of Agiles), Rilomundo {Hist, belli sacri)] : Ribemont, near 
St. Quentin (Dep. Aisne). Anselm was Count of Ostrevant 
and Valenciennes, founder of the religious house of Ribemont, 
and a great benefactor of the abbey of Anchin. He had 
played his part at Nicaea and Antioch before he was killed at 
Area. The two letters which he wrote from Antioch to 
Manasses, in French Manasse (English ManasseJi, Vulgate 
Manasses), Archbishop of Rheims, have been preserved (cf 
Hagenmeyer; Le Prevost ; von Sybel; Chans. d'Ant. ii, 
P*. 359 ; tiist. des Crois., Hist. occ. iii, pref., p, Iviii ; 

Riant, Invent. 165, About this time Pontius de Bala- 

duno, the friend and fellow-author whom Raymond of Agiles 
bitteily deplores, was killed by a stone from a petraria. B^ore 
Area also Peter Bartholomew went through the ordeal of 
fire, and died twelve days later. 



CHAPTER XXXVr

CHAPTER XXXVI. Page 84 

10. Anmiirahus Babyloniae : the Emir el-Afdal (cf. cc. xvii, 
xxxix). He had (R iii. 277) won Jerusalem for the Fatimites 
by bribery, after Kerboga’s defeat. R. of Agiles speaks of 
an embassy from the I^ng of Babylon to the Franks at Area, 
to which they replied, Quod nisi gratis redder et nobis lerusalem, 
Bahyloniam calumniareniur ei. 

16. Bethelon [Bethoron (Tud.) ] : the modern Batrun. 

17* Zebari [Gihelon (Tud.), Gibcllulnm castruni (F. of Char- 
tres), Gibilot (Alb. of Aix), Giobbeil (Abulfeda) ] : the ancient 
Byblus, the modem Jebeil (Jiblah), on the sea, south of 
Tripolis. 

19. Braym : the Nahr Ibrahim, which falls into the sea 
to the south of Byblus, 

20-1. via nimis angusta : the pass between Byblus and 
Berytus. 

25. Banith : Berytus, the modern Beirut. 

26. Sagitta : Sidon, the modern Saida. ' The former 
metropolis of all the Phoenician towns, and one of the oldest 
towns of the world ' (Hagenmeyer). It was now under 
Egyptian dominion. 

27. Sur : Tyre. Tyre was also under the Egyptians. It 
was a very important commercial centre, and a famous port. 

A cram [Acco (F. of Chartres) ]: the ancient Ptolemais, 
the modern Akka, Acre. The siege of Acre was the central 
episode of the Third Crusade, and its conquest by the Mamluks 
in 1291 marked the end of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 
(cf. R iii. of Agiles (R. 291) for the negotiations of the Crusaders 
with the emir of Acre). 

28. Cayphas: the modern ITaifa ; a seaport, at the northern 
foot of Mt. Carmel. 

29. Caesaream : Caesarea Turris Sfratonis, to be distin- 
guished from Caecarea Philippi and from Sheyzar (note, c. 
xxxiii. 23). 

31. Ramola [Ramore (c. xxxix), Rama, Ramleh]: since the 
Saracens had evacuated the town the Franks occupied it. 

33. honor abil is ecclesia ; this church seems to have been 
outside Ramleh, and to have belonged to Lydda, St. George’s 
birthplace, where, according to tradition, he was buried after 
his martyrdom at Nicomedia (cf. cc. ii, xxix). Ramleh 
and Lydda were close together, and might easily be confused. 
Another tradition places the martyrdom of St, George at 
Lydda. 

36—7. episcopum : Albert of Aix gives his name, Robertus, 
and W. of Tyre says that he was a Norman from the diocese 
of Rouen.

NOTES 


CHAPTER XXXVII. Page 86 

3. feria ieriia: Tuesday, June 7, but octauo Idiis lunii 
would be Monday, June 6. The right date is June 7. Cf. 
Tudebod (R iii, 102) : iii. feria, vii^ die intrante Jiinio (cf. 

F. of Chartres, (R iii, 355) ; Hagenmeyer, Cliron. de la Prem. 
Crois., pp. 236-7). 

4. eamque fjiirab inter obsedimus : for the siege of Jerusalem, 
Raymond of A^les, Albert of Aix, and William of Tyre should 
be read, in addition to the modern historians. Hagenmeyer’s 
notes on the text are very full and useful, and his Chronologie 
de la Premiere Croisade is indispensable for the sequence of 
events. There are good illustrations and a plan of the city 
in E. Heyck, Die Kreiizzuge und das heilige hand. 

5-6. 5 . Stephani . . . ectlesiam : this church lay to the north 
of the city. In 1099 it was in ruins. 

10. in monte Sion : the Proven9al army was at first on the 
west of the city. It afterwards took up a position on the hill 
of Sion on the south. The Church of St. Mary on Sion was on 
this hill (R. of Agiles, R iii. 293 ; F. of Chartres, Riii. 358). 

14. Arabes : by ' Arabs ’ Hagenmeyer here understands 
Bedouins. 

20. minorem . . . mitrum : the comparatively low outer or 
second wall on the north of the city. The other three sides 
were defended by a single wall of great height and strength. 

27. nanium : the Genoese ships at Joppa. 

29-30. Syloa . . . fons : the ‘ pool of Siloam ’ was on the 
eastern slope of Mt. Sion. 

35. lap Mae [Joppa, Jaffa} : niilliim enim alium portum 
habehamiis (F. of Chartres, R iii. 383). 

38. Wilhelmtts de Sabra: Sabran (Dep. Gard). Tudebod 
(R iii, 50) mentions William as one of the knights who guarded 
the fort Machumaria at Antioch. 

41. ammirauisi : el-xAfdal. 

CHiVPTER XXXVIII, Page 88 

4. niachinamenta : cf. Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxviii. i, note 2. 

31. comes Eu stack ins : the first passage in the Gesta in 
which Eustace of Boulogne is mentioned by name. 

32. Letholdus : he came from Tournai (Albert of Aix). 
All the copyists of the Gesta, with R. of Caen, the Hist, belli 
sacri, and Albert of Aix, make him the first to get over the 
wall; though the honour is not undisputed (Hagenmeyer, 

G. F, xxxviii. 4, note 18). 

35-6. templuni Salomonis : the modern el Aksa Mosque 



CHAPTER XXXVIII 


143 

on Mt. Moriah, on the south of the city : templum Salomonis 
magnum est et mimhile (F. of Chartres). 

37, cauillas : French cheville, ankle. 

39. castellum : the wooden siege-tower. 

50. Turri Datiid [Arx David (F. of Chartres) ] : the later 
citadel, on the west of the city. It formed part of the defences 
of the city wall, and was so strongly fortified that fifteen to 
twenty men could hold it against all attacks. 

portam : the West, Joppa, or Bethlehem Gate. 

60-1. Gaston de Be&rti Bearn (Tud.), Gastus de Bederz 
civitate (Beziers) (Alb. of Aix). 

65. Sepulcrum : this was the real goal of the pilgrim- 
soldiers. For descriptions of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 
cf. F. of Chartres and W. of Tyre, viii. 3. The caliph Hakim 
had destroyed the older church in a. d. 1000, but it was rebuilt 
in the first half of the eleventh century, and enlarged by the 
Crusaders (Hagenmeyer, G.F. xxxviii. 7, note 38). 

CHAPTER XXXIX. Page 91 

I. Margin : Godefndus, Rex Electus, Probably due to 
a copyist (cf. c. xxxii). It occurs in Bongars’ text. 

10. pyvae . . . sicutmetaei funeral pyres like hayricks or 
stacks, the corpses were heaped up so high. 

13. Scalonam : the port of Ascalon, the Egyptian door of 
entry into the Holy Land. 

15. principem ciuitatis: R. of Agiles (c. xl, R iii. 301) gives 
a simple straightforward account of Godfrey's election. Some 
of the clergy wanted a ' spiritual vicar ’ to be elected first, but 
the princes disregarded their wishes and proceeded to the 
election of a king. Raymond of Toulouse was approached : 
hortabantur principes comitem Sancti Aegidti, ut acciperet 
regnum ; but he refused, saying nomen regium se perhorrescere 
in ilia civitate. Godfrey was then unanimously chosen : 
elegerunt pariter ducem. Other authorities mention Robert of 
Normandy and Robert of Flanders as candidates. Contem- 
porary chroniclers generally call Godfrey princeps, dux^ or 
advocatus Sancti Sepulcri, not, as is usual with later writers, 
rex. Fulcher of Chartres says that he would not be crowned 
king, and the Hist, belli sacri gives the well-known story of his 
refusal to wear a royal crown where Christ had worn a crown 
of thorns (cf. E. Barker, The Crusades, p. 24 ; Hagenmeyer, 
G.F. xxxix. 3, note 12). 

16--17. patriarcham : the former patriarch, Simeon, had 
taken refuge in the island of Cyprus. He died in 1099. Arnulf 
had been chaplain to Robert of Normandy, and he was also 
in favour with Odo of Bayeux, who died in Sicily on the way

to the Holy Land. He and the bishop of Martorano were very 
unpopular with the Proven9al party, chiefly because of their 
scepticism on the subject of the Holy Lance. He seems to 
have been gifted and eloquent, but to have made many 
enemies (cf. Dodu, Royaiime de Jerusalem ; Archer and 
Kingsford, The Crusades).

of the patriarch Arnulf and hostile to Provengal interests.
