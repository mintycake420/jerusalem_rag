After so many ages and revolutions, these instincts yet live in our midst. Such are the two sources from which one must ever draw, should one seek to fathom the difficult art of seating societies upon firm foundations and ordering the dealings of men in an equitable manner. The **Roman Laws** present the widest and purest application of the principles of **Natural Law** (*droit naturel*—universal justice inherent in nature) unto the particular customs of a folk. The **Feudal Laws**, by contrast, manifest how **Conventional Law** (*droit conventionnel*—law established by custom or agreement), that law which is begotten of circumstance and resteth upon injustice and privilege, doth come to strengthen and make manifest its power.

These labors, guided oft-times by a rightful admiration, and at other times by an exceeding zeal, brought forth a succession of works worthy of the Code that had inspired them.
