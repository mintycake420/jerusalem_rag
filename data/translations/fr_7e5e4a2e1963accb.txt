Must we conclude that these ideas were entirely foreign to the populations that Rome had brought under her yoke, and that their appearance produced, in the heart of these peoples, the effect of a novelty for which ancient ideas and customs were in no way prepared? No, certainly not. 

The weakness and neglect of the Roman administration during the era of the Late Empire (*Bas-Empire*), and the injustices and disorders that followed, gave rise in the provinces to customs whose analogy with those of feudalism cannot be contested. The situation of small landowners was sad and miserable, for they remained exposed to the violence of powerful men and magistrates, without anyone taking up their defense.
