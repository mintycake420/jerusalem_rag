...In the realm of policy, naught appeared new to the eye, nor aught that might not be deemed the fruit of that which had gone before.

When a principle is deeply rooted in the customs (*moeurs*) of the people, the lawgiver feeleth no need to commit it to parchment nor to proclaim it aloud; yet when such a principle beginneth to be assailed and to falter, then doth he seek to fix it in writing, that it may be shielded, by this means, from error and the malice of false interpretation. The feudal system rested upon a few simple and manifest ideas, which spread throughout all Christendom in like manner and at the same season; yet to point to the precise hour when the labor of these ideas brought forth, in every land, the feudal order—or to name the law which, in France, Germany, or Italy, gave sanction to the establishment of this manner of governance—this is a task beyond our reach.
