...examples, and one would see that all attempts to assign a precise date to the birth of feudality (*féodalité*) have brought forth no certain result.

When feudality had triumphed over the obstacles it had encountered, it entered upon a new path and set about freely developing the principles it bore within its breast. Like all powers that have had to struggle to win recognition, it became, after the victory, less exclusive, less violent, and less inflexible; it offered but weak resistance to the disposition shown by the spirit of the age to fix and study its dogmas, or to submit its usages to examination and critique. Several memorable events contributed to the falling away of those obstacles which still opposed the free manifestation of feudal principles. These events signal the beginning of a new era for feudality; it is therefore important to explain with exactitude their character and consequences.

One may easily foresee that if a people subject to particular institutions goes to establish itself as a victor in a country where these institutions are unknown, it shall find itself under the obligation to determine in a precise manner its customs and usages, whether to make them known to the vanquished, or to better remember them while upon a foreign soil. To neglect a precaution so important would be to leave to the manners (*mœurs*) of the vanquished people the power to react upon the victors and to denature the results of the conquest.
