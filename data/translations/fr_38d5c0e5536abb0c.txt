The landowners perceived that it behooved them to require of their grantees not a mere rent in coin, but military service; this was done so that, should the common property one day be threatened, all those who had an interest in repelling aggression might take up arms and place themselves under their command. Soon this proprietor, having become the chief of his canton, recognized that the measures he had taken against the ambitious desires of a neighbor or a rival more powerful than himself were insufficient, and that with a mere handful of warriors he could not provide for the security of his domains. Thus, he resigned himself to solicit from the wealthiest and most redoubtable lord of the province that same manner of protection which he himself granted to landowners of a lower order. 

The same evils brought about the employment of the same remedies in every place; thus it was that all proprietors found themselves bound one to another, according to the measure of their power, by a chain of reciprocal rights and duties which extended from the lowest ranks of society to the highest. Such was the germ of feudalism (*féodalité*). It is bootless to examine whether this foundation of a political organization, which became so formidable, was well or ill chosen, just or unjust, enduring or fragile: necessity alone gave it birth, for there existed no other means to prevent the final elements of civilization from perishing. 

The agricultural class—whose condition had not changed since the Roman era, and which, in recompense for its toils to provide for the material needs of this disordered society, could hope for nothing but the favors of a *colonat* (a system of tenant farming where laborers were bound to the land) little distinct from slavery—obtained armed protectors. These guardians, if they did not always ensure peace and good order, were at least bound to do so by their own interest and by their engagements.
