...at once the passion for science and the love of the fatherland. The inferiority of French writers in this regard arises less from the nature of their intellect or their erudition than from political motives which, in this instance as well, have proved detrimental to the merit of their labors. 

The Crown gradually divested the lords of all those political prerogatives which the feudal constitution of the realm had accorded them; yet it permitted them the enjoyment of those pecuniary rights [financial dues] which they had hitherto exacted from their vassals and their men. Following the total triumph of the Crown in France, there persisted in that land a feudalism, yet a feudalism purely pecuniary, and consequently grasping, litigious, and prone to suit. This new feudalism, so divergent and so little worthy of the old, gave rise to a peculiar legislation which reached back no further than the era when the customs were first set down in writing, and which moved within a most narrow circle of practical notions. 

Nevertheless, as this legislation upheld the existence of rights as lucrative for the lords as they were burdensome for the common people, it attained great significance. A multitude of jurisconsults [legal scholars], foremost among whom must be placed Dumoulin (1), devoted themselves to establishing its principles and regularizing their application in works which were doubtless of great utility at the time of their appearance. In these, one still takes pleasure today in admiring the erudition and sagacity of their authors; yet, having been composed for the sake of practical utility, they no longer possess, from the standpoint of science, any real value. 

Feudalism was better preserved in Germany, and was not there reduced so early to the mean proportions of a fiscal system. The jurisconsults of that country were thus able to remain within the realm of great speculative and historical inquiries, and so ensure for their writings a lasting renown. It is evident that in France several causes, independent of the merit of the historians...
