### Concerning the Digital Scroll of Google

Albeit this work be of American origin, let it not be deemed by the reader that the same statutes hold sway in all other lands. The lawful duration of the rights of authors doth vary from one realm to another. We are, therefore, not empowered to set down a full reckoning of those works whose use is permitted and those whereon a prohibition yet lieth. Think not that the mere display of a book upon the Search of Books by Google signifieth that the same may be used in any manner whatsoever throughout the whole world. The condemnation to which a man might expose himself in the event of a violation of these rights may be right grievous and severe.

**Touching the Service of Google for the Search of Books**

By furthering the search for and the access unto a growing number of books available in many tongues, including the French, Google desireth to aid in the promotion of cultural diversity by means of this Search of Books. Verily, the Program of Google for the Search of Books alloweth those who travel upon the inner-net to discover the literary heritage of the world, while aiding authors and publishers to enlarge their audience. Ye may perform searches online within the full text of this work at the address: http://books.google.com.
