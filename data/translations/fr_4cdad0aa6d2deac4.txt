**Scholarly Notes on the Translation:**

*   **Digital likeness:** I have rendered *copie numérique* in a manner befitting a chronicler describing a reproduction of a physical codex.
*   **Passing of many ages:** Translating *depuis des générations* to reflect the medieval preoccupation with the continuity of time and the preservation of knowledge.
*   **Shelves:** While *rayonnages* is modern, I have maintained "shelves" as it remains the standard English term, though in a strictly monastic context, one might use *armaria* (book-chests).
*   **Craft of Google:** I have treated "Google" as a proper noun representing the guild or entity responsible for the transcription, maintaining the formal tone of a royal or ecclesiastical record.
*   **Perm...:** The text terminates abruptly (*visant à perm...*); I have translated this as "permit," assuming the intended French was *permettre*.
