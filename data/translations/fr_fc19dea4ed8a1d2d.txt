The Law of the Twelve Tables was engraved, as all men know, upon tablets of wood or ivory and set forth in the Forum, before the rostra [the tribune for public oratory], to the end that every citizen might gain knowledge thereof. This law must likewise have been transcribed upon marble or upon bronze; wherefore should it be forbidden us to suppose—though the fulfillment of such hope be but little probable—that some fortunate discovery might restore to life its primitive text, and cast of a sudden the brightest light upon the origins of Roman law? Thus one perceiveth how, in those sciences which take the appraisal of facts for their foundation, the dominion of received ideas is but poorly established.

There hovereth over the origin of feudal law an even greater uncertainty, notwithstanding the proximity of the times and the great multitude of testimonies, than over the sources of Roman law; yet the causes of this uncertainty are not the same in these two legislations. Feudalism [the medieval system of land tenure and mutual obligation] rested upon no positive stipulation, nor upon any written or formal law; its principles were neither studied, nor fixed, nor committed to writing until signs of decadence were already manifest in its midst. Had this truth, the evidence of which we shall presently demonstrate, not been overlooked, many writers of distinguished learning and zeal would not have exhausted themselves in seeking that which was nowhere to be found, nor in assigning a precise date to the birth of a society that formed itself but slowly, under the rule of principles which time alone could transform into a political system.
