+ **Ye shall send no mechanical engines nor automated inquiries unto the system of Google.** Should ye be engaged in the study of the craft of translation, or the art of discerning letters by light [OCR: *Optical Character Recognition*], or other such deep learning requiring great store of text, we bid you seek our counsel. We do encourage such labors when they involve works of the public domain [common heritage], and we should be right glad to be of service to you.

+ **Ye shall not strike out the mark of authorship.** The signet of Google, set upon every page, is most needful to inform all who dwell in the world of our great work and to guide them unto further records through the Google Scriptorium. Ye shall remove it in no wise.

Though a tome be free of claim in the American lands, assume not that it is so in other realms. The lawful duration of a book’s protection [copyright] doth vary from one kingdom to another.
