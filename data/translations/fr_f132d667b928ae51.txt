They sought not that assent of the peoples which ensureth the duration of wise and beneficent legislations. Like the Roman laws, they were born within a society where injustice reigned under the name of aristocracy, and violence under that of servitude; yet the Roman legislator, casting off the yoke of the traditions which environed him, rose by the full strength of his genius toward the purest principles of *droit commun* [common right or universal law]; thus it was that his laws were able to adapt themselves to the mores of diverse nations, and to subjugate even those peoples whose mission was to annihilate them and efface the very vestige of their influence.

The feudal laws were the peculiar product of the ideas and customs of certain peoples of Northern Europe; they were thus, from their very inception, confined within a narrow circle and condemned never to depart from it. Those modifications which time introduceth into the usages and requirements of nations held no sway over them; and when their might, which was their sole virtue, began to wane, there commenced against them that ardent and tireless struggle which was to lead to the triumph of justice and of common right. 

All the nations of Europe took part in this war against feudalism, though not with equal fervor, but each according to the measure of its *lumières* [intellectual enlightenment] and the exigencies of its political state. Germany and England sought less to annihilate it than to render its principles compatible with a calm and regular social order, whereas Italy and Spain succeeded in stifling it by employing against it the municipal system—its most formidable adversary after the Crown. 

The struggle between feudal right and common right was complete, and marked by those incidents which render such a combat instructive and curious, only in France; it is in the history of this land alone that one may follow with facility and method the development of these two opposing principles, and embrace [their entire course...]*

**Translator’s Notes on Historical Terms:**
*   **Droit commun:** In this context, it refers to "Common Right" or the Roman-influenced legal principles intended to apply to all citizens, as opposed to the fragmented, privilege-based "Feudal Right."
*   **Système municipal:** Refers to the "Municipal System," the Roman tradition of urban self-governance and chartered towns which often acted as a counterweight to the power of feudal lords.
*   **Lumières:** Literally "Lights," referring to the intellectual progress or enlightenment of a particular nation.
*   **Note on OCR:** The final word "embj" is truncated; based on the context of 19th-century historiography, it is likely a fragment of *embrasser* (to embrace or encompass the whole of the subject).
